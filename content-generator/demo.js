const sampleContent = `## What is AI Content Optimization?

AI Content Optimization (AIO) is the practice of structuring and enhancing content to perform well in AI-powered search systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google's AI Overviews. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on ranking in search results, AIO optimizes for selection and citation by AI systems.

According to recent research from [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com), properly optimized content sees a **115% increase in visibility** within AI-generated responses. This dramatic improvement comes from understanding how AI systems process and select information.

### Key Statistics:
- **99%** of Fortune 500s use AI, but only **5%** see ROI
- ChatGPT holds only **0.25%** of Google's search volume
- Content with citations has **115% better visibility**
- **78%** of employees use shadow AI tools daily

### The Three Pillars of AIO:

1. **Structural Clarity**: Use clear headers, lists, and logical flow
2. **Citation Authority**: Include credible sources and data points
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Answer all related questions thoroughly

*This approach addresses the pain point identified by Reddit users: "struggling with getting content picked up by AI chatbots" - a common challenge faced by 67% of content creators in 2025.*`;
