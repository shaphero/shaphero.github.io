But it’s the reason why those pilots failed that should make the C-suite anxious By Jeremy Kahn By Jeremy Kahn Editor, AI Jeremy Kahn Editor, AI Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune , spearheading the publication&#x27;s coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI , Fortune ’s flagship AI newsletter. SEE FULL BIO An MIT study that found that 95% of AI pilot projects fail spooked the stock market this week, driving the shares of many tech companies sharply lower. But the reasons for the failures the research highlighted were less about the underlying tech and more about the poor choices companies are making in using it. Photo illustration by Getty Images Hello and welcome to Eye on AI…In this edition: DeepSeek drops another impressive model…China tells companies not to buy Nvidia chips…and OpenEvidence scores an impressive result on the medical licensing exam. Hi, it’s Jeremy here, just back from a few weeks of much needed vacation. It was nice to be able to get a little distance and perspective on the AI news cycle. (Although I did make an appearance on Rana el Kaliouby’s “Pioneers of AI” podcast to discuss the launch of GPT-5. You can check that out here .) Returning this week, the news has been all about investor fears we’re in an “AI bubble”—and that it is about to either pop or deflate. Nervous investors drove the shares of many publicly-traded tech companies linked to AI-related trades, such as Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft , and Alphabet down significantly this week. To me, one of the clearest signs that we are in a bubble—at least in terms of publicly-traded AI stocks—is the extent to which investors are actively looking for reasons to bail. Take the supposed rationale for this week’s sell-off, which were Altman’s comments that he thought there was an AI bubble in venture-backed, privately-held AI startups and that MIT report which found that 95% of AI pilots fail. Altman wasn’t talking about the public companies that stock market investors have in their portfolios, but traders didn’t care. They chose to only read the headlines and interpret Altman’s remarks broadly. As for that MIT report, the market chose to read it as an indictment of AI as a whole and head for the exits—even though that’s not exactly what the research said, as we’ll see in a moment. I’m going to spend the rest of this essay on the MIT report because I think it is relevant for Eye on AI readers beyond its implications for investors. The report looked at what companies are actually trying to do with AI and why they may not be succeeding. Entitled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, the report was published by MIT Media Lab’s NANDA Initiative. (My Fortune colleague Sheryl Estrada was one of the first to cover the report’s findings. You can read her coverage here .) NANDA is an acronym for “Networked-Agents and Decentralized AI” and it is a project designed to create new protocols and a new architecture for an internet full of autonomous AI agents. NANDA might have an incentive to suggest that current AI methods aren’t working—but that if companies created more agentic AI systems using the NANDA protocol, their problems would disappear. There’s no indication that NANDA did anything to skew its survey results or to frame them in a particular light, but it is always important to consider the source. Ok, now let’s look at what the report actually says. It interviewed 150 executives, surveyed 350 employees, and looked at 300 individual AI projects. It found that 95% of AI pilot projects failed to deliver any discernible financial savings or uplift in profits. These findings are not actually all that different from what a lot of previous surveys have found—and those surveys had no negative impact on the stock market. Consulting firm Capgemini found in 2023 that 88% of AI pilots failed to reach production. (S&amp;P Global found earlier this year that 42% of generative AI pilots were abandoned—which is still not great). You’re doing it wrong But where it gets interesting is what the NANDA study said about the apparent reasons for these failures. The biggest problem, the report found, was not that the AI models weren’t capable enough (although execs tended to think that was the problem.) Instead, the researchers discovered a “learning gap”—people and organizations simply did not understand how to use the AI tools properly or how to design workflows that could capture the benefits of AI while minimizing downside risks. Large language models seem simple—you can give them instructions in plain language, after all. But it takes expertise and experimentation to embed them in business workflows. Wharton professor Ethan Mollick has suggested that the real benefits of AI will come when companies abandon trying to get AI models to follow existing processes—many of which he argues reflect bureaucracy and office politics more than anything else—and simply let the models find their own way to produce the desired business outcomes. (I think Mollick underestimates the extent to which processes in many large companies reflect regulatory demands, but he no doubt has a point in many cases.) This phenomenon may also explain why the MIT NANDA research found that startups, which often don’t have such entrenched business processes to begin with, are much more likely to find genAI can deliver ROI. Buy, don’t build The report also found that companies which bought-in AI models and solutions were more successful than enterprises that tried to build their own systems. Purchasing AI tools succeeded 67% of the time, while internal builds panned out only one-third as often. Some large organizations, especially in regulated industries, feel they have to build their own tools for legal and data privacy reasons. But in some cases organizations fetishize control—when they would be better off handing the hard work off to a vendor whose entire business is creating AI software. Building AI models or systems from scratch requires a level of expertise many companies don’t have and can’t afford to hire. It is also means that companies are building their AI systems on open source or open weight LLMs—and while the performance of these models has improved markedly in the past year, most open source AI models still lag their proprietary rivals. And when it comes to using AI in actual business cases, a 5% difference in reasoning abilities or hallucination rates can result in a substantial difference in outcomes. Finally, the MIT report found that many companies are deploying AI in marketing and sales, when the tools might have a much bigger impact if used to take costs out of back-end processes and procedures. This too may contribute to AI’s missing ROI. The overall thrust of the MIT report was that the problem was not the tech. It was how companies were using the tech. But that’s not how the stock market chose to interpret the results. To me, that says more about the irrational exuberance in the stock market than it does about the actual impact AI will have on business in five years time. With that, here’s the rest of the AI news.

That’s according a story in the Financial Times that said Beijing had found U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s comments that the U.S. was withholding its best technology from China to be “insulting.” CAC, China’s internet regulator, issued an informal notice to major tech companies such as ByteDance and Alibaba, asking them to halt new orders for Nvidia H20s. MIIT, the country’s telecom and software regulator, and the NDRC, the state planning agency which is leading a drive for tech independence, have also issued guidance telling companies not to purchase Nvidia chips. The agencies have cited security concerns as the rationale for their stance, but unnamed Chinese officials told the newspaper that Lutnick’s comments also played a role. DeepSeek launches its V3.1 model to enthusiastic reviews. The Chinese frontier AI company released an updated version of its powerful V3 LLM open source AI model. V3.1 features a larger context window than its predecessor, meaning it can handle longer prompts and more data. It also uses a hybrid architecture that only activates a fraction of its 685 billion parameters for each prompt token, making it faster and more efficient than some rival models. It also features better reasoning and agentic capabilities than the original V3, which was the underlying model DeepSeek then used to create its wildly successful R1 reasoning model. On benchmark tests so far, the V3.1 is competitive with proprietary models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic at a much lower price point—just over $1 for some coding tasks compared to $70 for rivals.

OpenAI CFO Sara Friar told Bloomberg that the company is considering renting out AI-optimized data centers and infrastructure to other companies in the future, similar to Amazon’s AWS—even though OpenAI currently struggles to find enough data center capacity for its own operations. Friar also said the company is exploring financing options beyond debt as it faces immense costs, with CEO Sam Altman predicting trillions of dollars in future data center spending. Friar also confirmed in an interview with CNBC that the company recently hit $1 billion in monthly revenue for the first time, while Bloomberg reported that secondary share sales have valued the company at $500 billion.

The finding is stark: Only about 5% of pilots have made it into production with measurable value. And the difference isn’t explained by model quality or regulation. It comes down to approach. Trend-Chasing vs. Strategy: How It Fuels AI Pilot Failure Businesses have a long history of stampeding toward the so-called next big thing. Blockchain, metaverse, Web3: all carried more hype than return on investment. AI is following the same pattern. Too many executives are green-lighting projects not because they solve a defined business problem, but because they feel they all need an AI initiative. The MIT study makes clear that the bulk of investment (roughly 50% to 70% of AI budgets in executive samples) has flowed to sales and marketing pilots. These projects are easy to pitch internally. Many decision-makers don’t really understand technology, so abstract use cases in operations or finance can be hard to explain and justify . But sales and marketing applications — tools that promise to write for you, generate auto-responses, or deploy chatbots to answer customer questions—are simple to imagine. MORE FOR YOU These initiatives also play to a common misperception: The real value in human connection with customers lies in getting words out quickly, or in fixing punctuation and spelling, rather than in the deeper work of listening, understanding, and shaping meaningful interactions. Seduction Of Sales And Marketing AI: The Most Visible AI Pilot Failures Sales and marketing pilots dominate early AI efforts because they’re easy to imagine and measure. But they’re also where many failures are most visible. Think of the chatbots that enrage customers, copy that erases brand voice, email that offends prospects, or sales outreach that overwhelms without engaging. MIT’s data underscores these risks: Sales and marketing capture the majority of budgets, but the real cost savings are emerging in back-office functions. Companies are playing in the shallow end while ignoring deeper value pools. And the MIT report shows that the real returns so far have come from less glamorous areas like back-office automation, procurement, finance, and operations. In other words, trend-chasing is crowding out smarter, quieter opportunities. Alignment Matters More Than Algorithms In Preventing AI Pilot Failure Companies already struggle to keep their arrows pointed in the same direction. Strategy lives in PowerPoint while marketing runs in one lane, sales in another, and operations somewhere else entirely. Technology doesn’t fix misalignment . It amplifies it. Automating a flawed process only helps you do the wrong thing faster. Add AI, and you risk runaway damage before anyone realizes what’s happening. MIT’s research echoes this: Most enterprise tools fail not because of the underlying models, but because they don’t adapt, don’t retain feedback and don’t fit daily workflows. The safeguard here is strategy. Without a solid, measurable strategy that aligns every division, department and individual, AI will accelerate misalignment, not resolve it. Why Internal-Only Efforts Lead To Higher AI Pilot Failure Rates One of MIT’s sharpest findings is that external partnerships reach deployment about twice as often (around 67%) as internally built efforts (roughly 33%). That aligns with what we’ve seen for decades across ERP, CRM and marketing automation projects. Internal teams know the business deeply. But they rarely have the applied knowledge that comes from running dozens of implementations across industries. It’s not about intelligence. It’s about mileage. External experts have 10,000-hour knowledge of sourcing, process-mapping, integrating, training, and refining software. Internal managers may know what they want, but they don’t always know what it takes to get there. The most effective implementations pair business experts on the inside with implementation experts on the outside. Technology Change Is Cultural Change The MIT report also highlights the rise of shadow AI. Employees at over 90% of surveyed companies already use personal AI tools like ChatGPT at work, while only about 40% of companies have purchased official licenses. This gap exposes how disconnected many official initiatives are from how people actually work. Cultural friction is often what sinks technology projects. IT departments worry about performance and risk. HR worries about culture, but isn’t trained in process integration. Line managers are caught between them. Without intentional attention to culture , adoption will collapse, no matter how capable the software. Ownership Can Kill ROI Culture also plays out in ownership. In one of our current projects, a senior manager is driving a global software rollout almost entirely on his own terms. It isn’t that he is deliberately sidelining other functions, but his limited understanding of their work, combined with his need to tightly own the project, is leaving little room for nuance about the other functions’ requirements. The system has gone live and, on paper, it counts as an implementation. In reality, it’s only about 65% of what the software could deliver. That gap is a failed ROI hiding behind surface success, and it shows how difficult it can be to teach or work around the natural human impulse to control what one doesn’t fully understand. MIT’s interviews confirm that success rates rise when organizations decentralize authority but keep accountability, letting managers and front-line teams shape adoption instead of relying on a central control group or, worse, a single gatekeeper. Understanding The Use Case Too often, companies begin with the software in mind — like saying, “We need AI for sales outreach.” But once you map the process, you discover the real bottleneck is disorganized data or inconsistent methodology. MIT’s report shows that the companies crossing the GenAI divide are the ones who demand process-specific customization and measure outcomes, not demos. Until you understand the use case, software selection is premature. Sometimes the right solution isn’t what was first imagined. Integration Or Bust: The Surest Way To Avoid AI Pilot Failure AI can’t just sit on top of your stack like a novelty add-on. Without integration into ERP, CRM, supply chain, and finance systems, it becomes a point of failure. The MIT report shows that generic tools like ChatGPT are widely piloted (about 80% explored; close to 40% deployed), but embedded, workflow-specific tools rarely cross into production (just about 5%). Integration is more than just connecting multiple systems. It is the dividing line between concept and impact. When AI sits off to the side, disconnected from the systems that actually run the business, it can’t influence decisions at the right level or deliver sustainable value. Worse, it introduces points of failure: fragmented data, conflicting signals, and processes that break under the weight of competing tools. That’s how companies end up amplifying bad decisions instead of improving them. True ROI comes only when AI is treated as part of the operating system of the business, not a layer sprinkled on top. The difference is between pilots that generate the kind of visible activity executives can easily understand and celebrate (the confetti of business), versus implementations that strengthen the underlying infrastructure where lasting value is created. By the Numbers: MIT’s GenAI Divide 2025 95% of enterprise AI initiatives deliver zero measurable return. 5% of custom/embedded tools reach production with impact. 80%+ of organizations have explored or piloted general LLMs; ~40% report deployment. 67% of externally partnered deployments succeed vs. 33% of internal builds. 50–70% of AI budgets go to Sales/Marketing, yet back-office automation delivers clearer ROI. Lead qualification speed: +40%; Customer retention: +10%; BPO cost reduction: $2–10M annually; Agency spend: –30%; Risk checks: $1M saved. Mid-market firms implement in ~90 days; enterprises take ~9 months. Pulling It Together The MIT research and decades of software history all point to the same conclusions: AI isn’t the problem. Faulty application is. The models are capable, but without the right approach they become expensive distractions rather than business drivers. Internal experts are essential, but insufficient. They know the business better than anyone else, but they don’t have the extensive applied knowledge that comes from running dozens of implementations. Without that experience, it’s easy to overlook integration challenges, underestimate cultural impact, fail to see cross-functional opportunities, or misjudge how workflows need to adapt. Expert advice pays for itself. That’s why external partnerships succeed at nearly double the rate of internal builds (about 67% versus 33%). The difference isn’t just in technical skill, but in knowing what to ask, what to anticipate, and how to navigate the rough patches that inevitably surface. That depth of experience compresses timelines, avoids false starts, and ensures ROI is realized rather than left on the table. Technology change is cultural change. Implementation is a full-company workout requiring process analysis and mapping, data analysis, hygiene, and planning, systems integration, and the hard work of engagement and training that leads to meaningful adoption. A Final Word MIT’s report is not a reason to avoid AI. It is a wake-up call. The GenAI divide makes clear that the real barriers are not technical—they are strategic, organizational, and cultural. The business world is not suffering from bad software. It’s suffering from poor strategy, trend-chasing, and misaligned execution. The companies that win with AI will be those that resist the urge to adopt quickly and instead adopt wisely, grounding every initiative in measurable strategy, ensuring alignment across the business, pairing internal expertise with external experience, and treating cultural change as seriously as code. AI will not save a business from itself. It’s not just the risk of AI pilot failure that is high. The true risk is in highlighting business weakness and accelerating business dysfunction. But for leaders disciplined enough to align, integrate, and manage the cultural shift, AI is capable of amplifying what is already strong at the core. Editorial Standards Reprints &amp; Permissions"

MIT’s research shows that 5% of GenAI pilots succeed by embracing resistance, both human and organizational, as well as technical, as the crucible of adaptation and ROI. getty 95% of GenAI Pilots Fail Friction isn’t failure. It’s what keeps your tires on the road, what makes a live experience memorable, and, according to MIT, what separates the 5% of GenAI pilots that succeed from the 95% that don’t. A new MIT study, State of AI in Business 2025 , reveals that billions of dollars invested in enterprise GenAI pilots are yielding no results. But the lesson isn’t that GenAI is broken. It’s that companies are trying to erase the very drag that creates value. The GenAI Divide MIT calls it the GenAI Divide. The 95% lean on generic tools, slick enough for demos, brittle in workflows. They’re stuck in high-adoption, low-transformation mode. The 5% design for friction. They embed GenAI into high-value workflows, integrating deeply and shipping tools with memory and learning loops. That’s where ROI lives. The data is stark: Only 5% of custom GenAI tools survive the pilot-to-production cliff, while generic chatbots hit 83% adoption for trivial tasks but stall the moment workflows demand context and customization. Why GenAI Needs Friction To Succeed I’ve long argued that humans need friction to stay human. Resistance is what gives life meaning, effort, constraint, the drag that makes judgment and authorship possible. MORE FOR YOU The MIT report shows the same law applies to GenAI. Without friction, GenAI is theater. Smooth demos impress, but without governance, memory, and workflow redesign, they deliver no value. The companies that succeed are those that engineer for friction, calibrating it rather than eliminating it. What GenAI Friction Really Means By friction, I don’t mean inefficiency for its own sake. I mean the resistance that forces adaptation. In physics, friction is what prevents your car from spinning out of control. In business, GenAI friction is the constraint that drives evolution: new protocols, conflicting incentives, the uncomfortable need to redesign workflows instead of layering another tool on top. MIT’s data proves the point: pilots that glide frictionless from demo to deployment never build the muscle to scale. They collapse the moment they hit real organizational texture, compliance, politics, data quality, and human judgment. By contrast, 5% of winners lean into friction: they accept resistance as the price of learning and design for it. The GenAI Verification Tax And The Accuracy Flywheel As Forbes contributor Jaime Catmull recently highlighted , another perspective on this is the “verification tax.” As PromptQL CEO Tanmai Gopal explained, when GenAI systems are confidently wrong, employees spend more time double-checking outputs than they save. That unmanaged friction kills ROI. The solution isn’t bigger models, it’s humbler ones. PromptQL refers to this as the “accuracy flywheel”: if the system is uncertain, it abstains, surfaces contextual gaps, and learns from user corrections. Each abstain → correction → improvement loop is friction at work. This humility-first design has gained traction in industries such as aerospace and finance, where one high-confidence miss can outweigh ten successes. It’s a living example of GenAI after friction: trust built not by removing drag, but by designing for it. The Experiential Parallel To GenAI As Rick Kiley, Founder of Soho Experiential, put it: “No behavioral change is possible without friction; people don’t come in thinking one thing and walk out thinking another unless they’re challenged. In experiences, friction is what creates the memory. GenAI is no different. If it’s too smooth, it fades. If it pushes you, it sticks.” The same truth applies across domains: Friction, when designed, doesn’t diminish value; it creates it. In enterprise GenAI, just as in live experiences, resistance is what builds trust, meaning, and differentiation. The three faces of GenAI friction, Human, Organizational, and Technical, highlight why most pilots fail. Enterprises that design for these frictions, rather than eliminating them, are the ones crossing MIT’s ‘GenAI Divide’ and capturing real ROI. Jason Snyder, Forbes In short, removing the wrong GenAI friction means losing the opportunity to learn. But design the right friction, and you get traction, meaning, and measurable value. “ Pilots stall because most tools cannot retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time, ” the authors of the MIT State of AI in Business 2025 wrote in their report. Case in point: MIT’s report highlights a “shadow AI” economy, where employees in over 90% of firms use personal AI tools even when official pilots fail. At one Fortune 500 insurer, the sanctioned GenAI pilot looked polished in the boardroom but collapsed in the field because it couldn’t retain context. Meanwhile, employees quietly rely on personal AI to speed up claims processing, part of a pattern that MIT says is already saving companies $2 million to $10 million a year in external costs and cutting agency spend by 30%. Shadow GenAI: The Real ROI Hiding In Plain Sight One of the report’s most striking findings: Even when enterprises don’t buy official tools, 90% of employees report using personal GenAI at work, versus only about 40% of firms with enterprise subscriptions. This so-called shadow GenAI is friction in action, the bottom-up reality of workers adopting what leadership won’t. On paper, the pilots may fail. In practice, shadow adoption is already producing ROI. Where The 5% Of GenAI Pilots Succeed While most GenAI pilots stall in what MIT calls the “adoption without transformation” trap, a minority are proving the exception. MIT’s research shows that the 5% who succeed follow a remarkably consistent playbook. They don’t chase flashy demos or generic tools; instead, they build systems that learn, admit uncertainty, and integrate deeply into workflows. These companies focus on partnerships that bring domain fluency and accountability, and they aim GenAI at the back office, where friction is most significant, but so are the savings. There’s a repeatable playbook: Learning loops and context retention . Humble GenAI that admits uncertainty and learns from corrections. External partnerships with customized vendors—twice as successful as internal builds. Back-office focus —where GenAI friction is highest and ROI is most direct. The GenAI Friction Playbook The lesson from MIT’s research is that friction isn’t the enemy of GenAI success—it’s the proof of it. The companies that scale beyond pilots don’t try to sand away every rough edge. They recognize that resistance reveals where systems need to adapt, where workflows must be redesigned, and where governance has to mature. In other words, friction is the signal that something real is happening. That’s why the 5% who succeed approach GenAI with a different mindset. They treat each source of friction — human, organizational, and technical — not as a barrier, but as a design input. Rather than rushing to show adoption metrics, they build for durability: systems that learn, contracts that incentivize outcomes, and governance that channels bottom-up energy instead of suppressing it. This mindset can be distilled into a practical framework. GenAI Friction Playbook Measure absorption, not adoption. Count workflows redesigned, not logins. Fund the memory layer. If it can’t retain context, it can’t scale. Redesign contracts. Demand vendors price against learning milestones, not seat licenses. Channel shadow GenAI. Formalize what employees are already doing, instead of banning it. Treat friction as a signal. If your pilot feels too smooth, it’s probably too shallow. GenAI After Friction Human after friction, GenAI after friction — the future won’t belong to those who erase the drag, but to those who design it well. The next wave, agentic GenAI systems with memory and adaptability, will test this truth even harder. The companies that accept friction as a feature, not a flaw, will be the ones that turn GenAI from theater into transformation. Because friction is more than a constraint, it’s a teacher. It forces systems to reveal their limits, and it forces leaders to make choices about what should be automated and what must remain human. It is the crucible where governance, trust, and creativity are forged. If the past decade of digital transformation was about removing friction, the next decade of GenAI will be about designing it wisely. Those who learn how to calibrate resistance enough to drive learning, rather than paralyze progress, will be the ones to capture not just ROI, but also resilience, meaning, and a lasting advantage.

          "content": "Newsletters · CFO Daily MIT report: 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing By Sheryl Estrada By Sheryl Estrada Senior Writer and author of CFO Daily Sheryl Estrada Senior Writer and author of CFO Daily Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune , where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily . SEE FULL BIO Getty Images Good morning. Companies are betting on AI—yet nearly all enterprise pilots are stuck at the starting line. The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025 , a new report published by MIT’s NANDA initiative, reveals that while generative AI holds promise for enterprises, most initiatives to drive rapid revenue growth are falling flat. Despite the rush to integrate powerful new models, about 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration; the vast majority stall, delivering little to no measurable impact on P&amp;L. The research—based on 150 interviews with leaders, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments—paints a clear divide between success stories and stalled projects. To unpack these findings, I spoke with Aditya Challapally, the lead author of the report, and a research contributor to project NANDA at MIT. “Some large companies’ pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,” Challapally said. Startups led by 19- or 20-year-olds, for example, “have seen revenues jump from zero to $20 million in a year,” he said. “It’s because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools,” he added. But for 95% of companies in the dataset, generative AI implementation is falling short. “The 95% failure rate for enterprise AI solutions represents the clearest manifestation of the GenAI Divide,” the report states. The core issue? Not the quality of the AI models, but the “learning gap” for both tools and organizations. While executives often blame regulation or model performance, MIT’s research points to flawed enterprise integration. Generic tools like ChatGPT excel for individuals because of their flexibility, but they stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows, Challapally explained. The data also reveals a misalignment in resource allocation. More than half of generative AI budgets are devoted to sales and marketing tools, yet MIT found the biggest ROI in back-office automation—eliminating business process outsourcing, cutting external agency costs, and streamlining operations. What’s behind successful AI deployments? How companies adopt AI is crucial. Purchasing AI tools from specialized vendors and building partnerships succeed about 67% of the time, while internal builds succeed only one-third as often. This finding is particularly relevant in financial services and other highly regulated sectors, where many firms are building their own proprietary generative AI systems in 2025. Yet, MIT’s research suggests companies see far more failures when going solo. Companies surveyed were often hesitant to share failure rates, Challapally noted. “Almost everywhere we went, enterprises were trying to build their own tool,” he said, but the data showed purchased solutions delivered more reliable results. Other key factors for success include empowering line managers—not just central AI labs—to drive adoption, and selecting tools that can integrate deeply and adapt over time. Workforce disruption is already underway, especially in customer support and administrative roles. Rather than mass layoffs, companies are increasingly not backfilling positions as they become vacant. Most changes are concentrated in jobs previously outsourced due to their perceived low value. The report also highlights the widespread use of “shadow AI”—unsanctioned tools like ChatGPT—and the ongoing challenge of measuring AI’s impact on productivity and profit. Looking ahead, the most advanced organizations are already experimenting with agentic AI systems that can learn, remember, and act independently within set boundaries—offering a glimpse at how the next phase of enterprise AI might unfold.

Big Deal Modern manufacturing relies heavily on connected devices and industrial control systems, which are prime targets for cyberattacks. For protection, manufacturers are increasingly turning to AI to help manage these risks, according to the State of Smart Manufacturing Report by Rockwell Automation, Inc. The report’s findings are based on a survey of more than 1,500 manufacturing leaders across 17 major manufacturing countries. Cybersecurity now ranks among the top external risks, second only to inflation and economic growth. One-third of respondents hold responsibilities spanning both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cybersecurity.

She also authors CFO Daily . SEE FULL BIO Getty Images Good morning. Companies are betting on AI—yet nearly all enterprise pilots are stuck at the starting line. The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025 , a new report published by MIT’s NANDA initiative, reveals that while generative AI holds promise for enterprises, most initiatives to drive rapid revenue growth are falling flat. Despite the rush to integrate powerful new models, about 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration; the vast majority stall, delivering little to no measurable impact on P&amp;L. The research—based on 150 interviews with leaders, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments—paints a clear divide between success stories and stalled projects. To unpack these findings, I spoke with Aditya Challapally, the lead author of the report, and a research contributor to project NANDA at MIT. “Some large companies’ pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,” Challapally said. Startups led by 19- or 20-year-olds, for example, “have seen revenues jump from zero to $20 million in a year,” he said. “It’s because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools,” he added. But for 95% of companies in the dataset, generative AI implementation is falling short. “The 95% failure rate for enterprise AI solutions represents the clearest manifestation of the GenAI Divide,” the report states. The core issue? Not the quality of the AI models, but the “learning gap” for both tools and organizations. While executives often blame regulation or model performance, MIT’s research points to flawed enterprise integration. Generic tools like ChatGPT excel for individuals because of their flexibility, but they stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows, Challapally explained. The data also reveals a misalignment in resource allocation. More than half of generative AI budgets are devoted to sales and marketing tools, yet MIT found the biggest ROI in back-office automation—eliminating business process outsourcing, cutting external agency costs, and streamlining operations. What’s behind successful AI deployments? How companies adopt AI is crucial. Purchasing AI tools from specialized vendors and building partnerships succeed about 67% of the time, while internal builds succeed only one-third as often. This finding is particularly relevant in financial services and other highly regulated sectors, where many firms are building their own proprietary generative AI systems in 2025. Yet, MIT’s research suggests companies see far more failures when going solo. Companies surveyed were often hesitant to share failure rates, Challapally noted. “Almost everywhere we went, enterprises were trying to build their own tool,” he said, but the data showed purchased solutions delivered more reliable results. Other key factors for success include empowering line managers—not just central AI labs—to drive adoption, and selecting tools that can integrate deeply and adapt over time. Workforce disruption is already underway, especially in customer support and administrative roles. Rather than mass layoffs, companies are increasingly not backfilling positions as they become vacant. Most changes are concentrated in jobs previously outsourced due to their perceived low value. The report also highlights the widespread use of “shadow AI”—unsanctioned tools like ChatGPT—and the ongoing challenge of measuring AI’s impact on productivity and profit. Looking ahead, the most advanced organizations are already experimenting with agentic AI systems that can learn, remember, and act independently within set boundaries—offering a glimpse at how the next phase of enterprise AI might unfold. Sheryl Estrada sheryl.estrada@fortune.com Leaderboard Michael A. Discenza was appointed VP and CFO of The Timken Company (NYSE: TKR), effective immediately. Discenza has 25 years of experience at Timken in roles of increasing responsibility, including the last 10 as VP of finance, and group controller.

Cole aims to strengthen the financial infrastructure to support the company’s next phase of growth. Big Deal Modern manufacturing relies heavily on connected devices and industrial control systems, which are prime targets for cyberattacks. For protection, manufacturers are increasingly turning to AI to help manage these risks, according to the State of Smart Manufacturing Report by Rockwell Automation, Inc. The report’s findings are based on a survey of more than 1,500 manufacturing leaders across 17 major manufacturing countries. Cybersecurity now ranks among the top external risks, second only to inflation and economic growth. One-third of respondents hold responsibilities spanning both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cybersecurity. Nearly half (48%) of cybersecurity professionals identified securing converged architectures as key to positive outcomes over the next five years, compared to just 37% of all respondents. However, a shortage of skilled talent, training challenges, and rising labor costs remain major hurdles. As manufacturers recruit the next generation, cybersecurity and analytical skills are becoming hiring priorities—reinforcing the need to align technical innovation with human development, according to the report. Going deeper In a new Fortune opinion piece , &quot;Future CEOs, erased: the economic cost of losing Black women in the workforce,&quot; Katica Roy, the CEO and founder of the Denver-based Pipeline, a SaaS company, explains the implications of almost 300,000 Black women exited the labor force so far this year—thinning a pipeline that was already too narrow. &quot;This isn’t a seasonal fluctuation or statistical footnote. It’s a strategic failure with long-term consequences,&quot; Roy writes. &quot;Black women have long been a cornerstone of America’s economic engine—driving participation, powering key industries, and anchoring family incomes. Now, that foundation is fracturing. And the fallout is more than short-term—it’s a direct threat to corporate succession planning, innovation, and growth. The U.S. economy has always depended on Black women’s labor. In fact, no group of women in America has historically had higher labor force participation than Black women.&quot; Overheard “Every single Monday was called &#x27;AI Monday.&#x27; You couldn’t have customer calls, you couldn’t work on budgets, you had to only work on AI projects.” —Eric Vaughan, CEO of enterprise software company IgniteTech, told Fortune in an interview that he established a mandate: on Mondays, staff could only work on AI.

The findings, based on 300 public deployments, more than 150 executive interviews, and $30 to $40 billion invested in these pilots, suggest that billions of dollars have been spent on AI experiments that never scale — and that most organizations are stuck on what MIT researchers call the “GenAI Divide.” The numbers in the “State of AI in Business 2025 ” are stark: 40% of organizations said they’ve deployed AI tools, but only 5% have managed to integrate them into workflows at scale. Most projects die in pilot purgatory. Meanwhile, headlines are warning of an “AI bubble,” and some investors are shorting AI stocks on the idea that generative AI’s big enterprise moment is already stalling out. Co-Founder and CEO of PromptQL, Tanmai Gopal PromptQL But not everyone agrees with that reading. “Confidently wrong is the problem,” said Tanmai Gopal, co-founder and CEO of PromptQL , a unicorn AI company that counts OpenAI, Airbus, Siemens, and NASA as its customers. “If the system is not always accurate even the tiniest percent of the time, I need to know when it’s not. Otherwise, my minutes turn into hours; the ROI disappears.” MORE FOR YOU The Verification Tax In his blog post , “Being ‘Confidently Wrong’ Is Holding AI Back,” Gopal described what he calls the “verification tax.” “I don’t know when I might get an incorrect response from my AI. So I have to forensically check every response,” he wrote. This tax explains much of what MIT labeled as the GenAI divide. Enterprises eagerly launch pilots, but employees end up spending so much time double-checking outputs that the promised efficiencies never materialize. It’s not that generative AI lacks raw horsepower — the models can be dazzling. It’s that their confidence is uncalibrated. In regulated or high-stakes industries, one bad answer can outweigh 10 good ones. As Gopal put it: “For serious work, one high-confidence miss costs more credibility than 10 successes earn.” The Learning Gap MIT’s researchers framed the same issue differently. They found that most enterprise AI tools don’t retain feedback, adapt to workflows, or improve over time. Without those qualities, they stall. Gopal agrees. “Without high-quality uncertainty information, I don’t know whether a result is wrong because of ambiguity, missing context, stale data, or a model mistake.&quot; “If I don’t know why it’s wrong,” he said, &quot;I’m not invested in making it successful.” That insight matters because it reframes the entire conversation. If AI isn’t failing due to lack of capability, but because it hasn’t been designed to communicate its limits and learn from corrections, then the fix is less about building bigger models — and more about building humbler ones. How PromptQL Solves It PromptQL has built its entire platform around solving this exact problem — what Gopal calls the difference between being “confidently wrong” and “tentatively right.” Instead of presenting outputs as gospel, PromptQL calibrates confidence at the response level: Quantifies uncertainty. Every answer comes with a confidence score. If the system is unsure, it abstains — effectively saying “I don’t know. Surfaces context gaps. Rather than hiding uncertainty, the system flags why an answer may be unreliable: missing data, ambiguity, or lack of context. Builds an accuracy flywheel. Each abstention or correction becomes training fuel. PromptQL captures those signals, letting the system improve continuously — closing the “learning gap” MIT identified as the number one cause of pilot failure. Integrates into workflows. Instead of sitting in a chatbox, PromptQL embeds directly into enterprise processes like contracts, engineering, or procurement, so uncertainty flags and corrections appear exactly where the work is happening. “The starting point of this loop is if an AI system could tell the user when it’s not certain about its accuracy in a concrete and native way,” Gopal wrote. That loop — abstain, get corrected, learn — is what he calls the accuracy flywheel. “We don’t need perfection; we need a loop that tightens.” Tentatively Right Beats Confidently Wrong This humility-first approach has led to adoption in some of the most skeptical corners of the enterprise market. While 95% of pilots stall, PromptQL is closing seven- and eight-figure contracts with Fortune 500s, government agencies, and regulated industries — the exact places MIT says AI has struggled to gain traction. The company is living proof that enterprise AI is not failing. The wrong kind of enterprise AI is. As Gopal puts it: “No amount of solving any other problem — integration, data readiness, organizational readiness — will change the fact that AI’s tendency to be confidently wrong keeps it out of real-world use cases.” A Different Conclusion The takeaway, then, is not that AI is doomed to fail. It’s that enterprises must demand a different kind of AI — one that is transparent about its uncertainty, tightly integrated into workflows, and capable of improving with every interaction. The MIT report is right to highlight the GenAI divide. But if we only focus on the 95% that failed, we miss the 5% that are actually scaling — and why. The companies that build and adopt AI that admits when it doesn’t know are quietly rewriting the story. PromptQL is one of them. But they’re not alone— Anthropic has made this issue a priority and has been conducting extensive research into creating similarly reliable outputs. And if their traction holds, the conclusion isn’t that enterprise AI is a bubble. It’s that a small handful of companies have already figured out how to burst it.

          "content": "3 Min Read That Viral MIT Study Claiming 95% of AI Pilots Fail? Don’t Believe the Hype. By Mike Kaput on August 26, 2025 Get access to all AI courses with an AI Mastery Membership. Learn More A new study from MIT has sent shockwaves through the business world with a stunning claim: 95% of enterprise generative AI pilots are failing , delivering zero measurable return on investment. The report, titled “ The GenAI Divide ,” suggests that despite a rush of $30 to $40 billion in enterprise spending, the vast majority of companies remain stuck, unable to extract real value from their AI initiatives. The finding quickly went viral, fueling a narrative that we’re in an AI bubble and the technology is massively overhyped. But is that the real story? To get past the explosive headline, I talked it through with Marketing AI Institute founder and CEO Paul Roetzer on Episode 164 of The Artificial Intelligence Show . He argues that a closer look at the study’s methodology reveals a very different picture. A Headline That Demands Skepticism When Roetzer first saw the 95% failure rate, his immediate reaction was skepticism. “Anytime you see a headline like that, you have to immediately step back and say, okay, that seems unrealistic,” he says. He points out that profound claims require profound evidence, and this study doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. After the report flooded his LinkedIn feed and came up repeatedly in live events, Roetzer did a deep dive into its methodology that led him to a firm conclusion: “Please don’t put any weight into this study,” he warns. “This is not a viable, statistically valid thing.” Unpacking the Flawed Methodology Here’s where the research falls apart, according to Roetzer: It has a narrow definition of success. The study defined success as “deployment beyond pilot phase with measurable KPIs” and an “ROI impact measured six month post pilot.” This narrow focus on direct P&amp;L impact within just six months ignores many other critical ways AI delivers value. It ignores key metrics. The methodology didn’t seem to account for crucial business impacts like efficiency gains, cost reductions, customer churn reduction, lead conversion improvements, or sales pipeline velocity. Roetzer asks, “If you're going to say something has zero return, how can you do that without acknowledging all the other ways that AI can benefit a business?” It has some questionable sources of data. The finding of “zero return” was based on just 52 interviews that the report itself admits are only “directionally accurate based on individual interviews rather than official company reporting.” Furthermore, the report touts an analysis of over 300 public AI initiatives but never explains how that research was conducted or synthesized into the findings. Why Bad Data Spreads So Fast The MIT study went viral not because it was right, but because it fit a convenient narrative. People who believe AI is an overhyped bubble saw the headline as proof. It’s tempting to want data to support and validate what you believe to be true about AI, says Roetzer. And it’s easy to find data to support most perspectives. “But we need to be a little bit more honest with the things that we use to make these cases,” he says. He cautions that in the rush to be the first to share “breaking” news, many people skip the critical step of actually reading the research. Instead of jumping on the bandwagon, he advises taking a few minutes to read the methodology. Often, you’ll find that the data is being shaped to fit a pre-existing narrative or generate clicks. How to Actually Make Your AI Pilots Succeed While the study itself may be flawed, it serves as a valuable reminder for organizations to be strategic about their AI initiatives. Instead of getting bogged down in sensational headlines, Roetzer says companies should focus on the fundamentals of making pilot projects work. He recommends a simple, practical approach: Have a plan. Don’t just hand out tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini and hope for the best. Personalize use cases. Give employees three to five specific use cases that help them get value from day one. Provide education and training. Treat AI adoption as a change management initiative, not just a technology rollout. Know how you’ll measure success. Success isn’t always about immediate P&amp;L impact. Measure efficiency gains, productivity lifts, and other relevant metrics. A pilot’s success is rarely determined in just six months. The Bottom Line The viral MIT study is a critical lesson in media literacy for the AI era. While it’s tempting to seize on data that confirms our biases, it’s far more valuable to think critically, question headlines, and dig into the methodology behind the claims. The reality is that successful AI adoption isn't about chasing hype. It's about thoughtful planning, strategic implementation, and a clear-eyed view of how to measure success. As Roetzer advises, before you share the next shocking AI statistic. “Take three minutes and just read the methodology,” he says. You might find the real story is very different from the headline.

And the U.S. Treasury market—the holy grail of global finance—isn’t bulletproof anymore.**\n\n**Let’s recap:**\n\n* **Japan started quietly dumping Treasuries.** Data from Japan's Ministry of Finance indicates that Japanese investors were net sellers of foreign bonds in the week ending April 5, 2025, marking a significant shift in their investment behavior. [www.fxstreet.com](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-kato-says-will-not-sell-us-treasury-holdings-just-from-standpoint-of-us-japan-relations-202504090051)\n* **China responded to tariffs by not escalating—a silence that screamed “we’re ready.”** China's measured response to the U.S. tariffs suggests strategic positioning rather than immediate retaliation. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/09/dramatic-sell-off-of-us-government-bonds-as-tariff-war-panic-deepens)\n* **Japan, South Korea, and China began coordinating trade and financial policy.** Reports indicate that these nations have engaged in discussions to align their economic strategies in response to U.S. trade policies. [www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/japan/japans-ruling-camp-call-sales-tax-cut-yomiuri-reports-2025-04-10/)\n* **Canada issued a $3.5B USD bond, signaled reserve repositioning, and quietly hinted at coordinated selling.** Mark Carney didn’t even have to raise his voice—just moved a piece on the board and let the pressure rise. [www.snopes.com/](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/11/canada-mark-carney-treasurys-sell-off/)\n* **Bond yields exploded. Liquidity evaporated.** The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly surpassed 5%, reaching levels not seen since late 2023, signaling a significant drop in demand. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/09/dramatic-sell-off-of-us-government-bonds-as-tariff-war-panic-deepens)\n* **The Fed muttered, “we’ll stabilize markets if needed.”** This statement indicates the Federal Reserve's readiness to intervene in the markets to maintain stability amid the volatility.

This is a trust war.**  \nAnd trust—not tanks—is what backs the U.S. dollar.\n\n**Here’s what I didn’t get to post:**\n\n**The infrastructure broke.**  \nThe system cracked under the pressure.\n\nAccording to [Risk.net](http://Risk.net), over $2 trillion in U.S. Treasuries were traded per day during the height of the tariff fallout—double the average daily volume. [www.risk.net (Paywalled)](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7961376/treasury-selloff-challenges-back-office-systems)\n\nFIS and Trading Technologies—core post-trade platforms used by major brokerages—experienced significant processing delays due to the unprecedented trade volumes.\n\nThis wasn’t Reddit lagging under upvotes. This was the **clearing layer of the bond market going offline.**\n\nThat’s the nightmare:  \nA liquidity shock colliding with a back-office failure.  \nIt creates a bottleneck that spirals into **margin calls, repo freezes, counterparty chaos**, and then—  \n*maybe*—an actual market halt.\n\nAnd what happened right after?  \n**A surprise tariff exemption.**\n\n**Which brings me to the biggest tell of all: the walkback.**\n\nTrump spent days imposing 125% tariffs. Then suddenly:\n\n**He backs off. Quietly. Subtly. A pause. A delay. A face-saving half-reversal.**\n\n[content.govdelivery.com](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCBP/bulletins/3db9e55)\n\n**Why?**  \nBecause **the bond market screamed.**  \nBecause **Japan’s selling worked.**  \nBecause **the Treasury floor buckled—and the White House blinked.**\n\nThat tariff exemption **validates everything**:\n\n* If the tariffs were effective, there would be no need to flinch.\n* If China, Japan, or others weren’t leveraging their holdings, there’d be no fear.\n* If the Treasury market wasn’t exposed, the Fed wouldn’t have signaled intervention.\n\nThis was a **geopolitical stress test**—and the U.S. didn’t pass.  \nIt limped across the finish line.\n\n**So what now?**\n\nThis is the **foundation** under your economy catching fire.  \nAnd the Fed just checked the beams and heard them **hollow.**\n\nIf you missed the original post, I’ve reuploaded it onto my profile [An idiot's Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMysteryCheese/comments/1jxxss9/the_fed_just_blinked_china_is_about_to_nuke_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1).\n\nIf you’re a mod, just admit it rattled you. Don’t pretend it was “low effort” or “off-topic.”  \n**You know exactly what this was.**\n\n**If I’m wrong? Great. I’m an idiot with a flair for drama.**\n\n**But if I’m right?**\n\nI'll reiterate\n\nTick.  \nFucking.  \nTock.\n\n---\n\nEdit: \n\nTo save me responding to all the \"braindead/CCP cope/OP is an idiot\" comments:\n\n&gt;Cool, go buy calls about it then.\n\nAlso, for everyone else: \n\n&gt;Don't take me at face value, try and prove me wrong, then invest based on how well you feel you did.\n\n---\n\nAddendum: Consumer Credit Collapse\n\nAs u/couchsurfinggonepro rightly highlighted, I still managed to leave out a key point: the high risk of credit default at the consumer level.\n\nDespite the tribal noise in politics, here’s the truth:\nMost people are financially exhausted.\n\nCOVID didn’t just disrupt—it indebted. And while the headlines talk about jobs and inflation, the only real debate in Washington was: who gets bailed out and how?\n\nTrump’s “solution” is now playing out. And what it will unleash is:\n\n-Mass unemployment\n\n-Mortgage defaults\n\n-Credit card delinquencies\n\n-Student loan defaults\n\n-Personal bankruptcies\n\nThere is a bubble in personal consumer debt\n\n---\n\nAddendum 2: Margin Calls and Domestic Liquidity Fragility\n\nu/im_a_squishy_ai built on the analysis above, it’s not just foreign selling that's stressing the bond market—the domestic side is breaking too.\n\nMargin calls started going out to hedge funds on the first Thursday and Friday of the selloff. These weren’t triggered by any deep fundamental devaluation of equities—they were triggered simply because valuations reverted to a historical norm.\n\n&gt;Stocks fell to 15–20x forward earnings—which is textbook fair value. That’s not a crash. That’s a mean reversion.\n\nAnd yet, it triggered margin calls.\n\nThat tells us something:\nHedge funds are so over-leveraged that even a return to normal valuations creates a liquidity crisis. There is no buffer. There is no margin for error. No resilience.\n\nThis means this is another bubble—plain and simple. A structurally fragile one.\n\nAs the real economy begins to absorb job losses, business failures, declining earnings, and reduced consumer demand—all natural consequences of the tariff and credit tightening cycle—those margin calls are going to accelerate.\n\nThe market has already shown its hand:\n\n&gt;Just normalizing destabilizes it.\n\nBut we’re not heading for normal. We’re heading for a deterioration.\nAnd that means the next wave of selling won’t be orderly—it’ll be forced. Liquidations. Defaults. Fire sales.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 3: The Commercial Real Estate Time Bomb\n\nu/Pietes highlighted another structural fault line we need to talk about, commercial real estate—and specifically the overvaluation and fragility of REITs.\n\nMost commercial real estate isn’t bought outright. It’s acquired using loan-like financing structures, often leveraged against stock-based collateral or a fragile web of interconnected property portfolios. It’s a Jenga tower of credit assumptions—and all it takes is one piece to wobble.\n\nREITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are the largest holders of both commercial and residential real estate in the U.S. They are heavily dependent on valuation stability and rental yield expectations—both of which are at risk in the current macro environment.\n\nIn a scenario of rising rates, job losses, and liquidity-driven asset fire sales, REITs become amplifiers of systemic risk.\n\nIf the market faces renewed margin calls, and REIT valuations slip even modestly, their leverage unwinds\n\nIf property vacancies rise from business closures or consumer retrenchment, their cash flows evaporate\n\nAnd if broader financial players start selling REITs or their underlying mortgage-backed assets to meet liquidity demands, we’re looking at contagion across multiple sectors\n\nIn short: REITs are sitting on illiquid assets funded by borrowed optimism.\nIn a liquidity crunch, optimism is the first thing to vanish.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 4 : The Domestic Bank Run\n\nAs per u/Boobpocket on my original post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/s/2LMdR3Z3AQ\n\nThe recent policy move to freeze immigrant bank accounts is a potential flashpoint—and one that could blindside the financial system.\n\nIf even a fraction of the 15+ million account holders rush to withdraw their funds in fear of asset seizure or financial isolation, it could trigger a silent bank run.\n\nThis isn’t a regional bank failure or a crypto contagion. This is distributed, fragmented, and unpredictable—across every major bank and financial institution in the country.\n\nYou’re talking about:\n\nMass withdrawals\n\nLiquidity pressures\n\nForced reserve drawdowns\n\nPotential failures of smaller or mid-tier institutions\n\nAnd a surge in cash hoarding and offshore transfers that destabilizes confidence in retail banking itself\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether the policy gets enforced.\nThe fear alone, the signal it sends can do the damage.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 5: Trump Walks Back the Tariff Exemptions—Sort Of - 13th of April \n\nThere’s not much meat to this one yet, but it’s worth noting:\n\nTrump just called the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's own tariff guidance update—the one that signaled a soft exemption for Chinese chip imports—“fake news” on Truth Social.\n\n&gt; Yes, he’s calling his own administration’s federal directive fake.\n\nMake of that what you will.\nIs it a power struggle inside the executive? A tactic to confuse markets? Or just another moment of chaos-as-strategy?\n\nWhatever it is, it reintroduces uncertainty into a market that has barely begun to stabilize.\n\n\n[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/13/tariffs-chips-lutnick/)\n\n---\n\nAddendum 6: China Halts Exports of Rare Earth Minerals - 13th of April \n\nChina just put the brakes on one of the most strategically vital trade flows in the modern economy: rare earth minerals and magnets.\n\n&gt; “It will take 45 days before export licenses could be issued and exports... would resume,”\n—Michael Silver, CEO of American Elements (via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html))\n\n\nThis move can be read two ways—and both are bad for the U.S.:\n1. It’s a flex.\nChina is leveraging its chokehold on critical materials—used in everything from EVs to military hardware—to apply economic pressure in response to tariffs and bond hostility.\n\n2. It’s a mirror.\nChina is reminding the world that they are the factory, the mine, and the magnet. This isn’t just retaliation. It’s a demonstration of structural leverage. They don’t need to escalate. They just need to remind everyone how replaceable the U.S. is in the supply chain, and how irreplaceable China remains.\n\nEither way, this is a strategic maneuver, not a tantrum.\nAnd it just added more fuel to an already burning trust crisis in the U.S. financial leadership.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 7: Subprime Auto Loans\n\nu/ClicheCrime brings up the subprime auto loan industry, currently operating on borrowed time and collapsing collateral.\n\nCar values are plummeting as supply chain normalization floods the used market.\n\nBorrowers are underwater on high-interest loans, many with zero equity.\n\nDefaults are climbing, repo rates are spiking, and entire ABS (asset-backed securities) chains are quietly fraying.\n\nThis is 2008 subprime mortgages, but on wheels and with no bailout narrative.\n\nCars aren’t just assets. They’re lifelines.\nIn much of the U.S., no car means no job. There’s no public transport net to catch these people.\n\nSo what happens when millions lose access to work, default, and spiral into personal insolvency?\n\nNo car, no job.\nNo job, no payments.\nNo payments, no stability.\n\n[www.creditchronometer.com](https://www.creditchronometer.com/subprime-auto-is-there-a-bad-moon-on-the-rise)\n\n---\n\nAddendum 8: Foreign Pensions Begin Pullback from U.S. Equities - 14th of April \n\nOn April 14, reports emerged that major Danish and Canadian pension funds are actively reassessing and, in some cases, reducing their investments in U.S. equities due to escalating geopolitical tensions and market instability.\n\n- Denmark's PFA, the country's largest pension fund, has been reducing its overweight in equities over the past month, citing increasing uncertainty stemming from recent trade policies and market volatility .\n\n- Canadian pension funds are also pausing new investments in U.S. private markets, expressing concerns over the current economic climate and policy unpredictability .\n\n\nThese moves are significant. Pension funds are typically long-term investors, and such shifts indicate a growing unease about the stability of U.S. markets. The potential ripple effects include:\n\nReduced foreign capital inflows into U.S. equities, potentially leading to decreased market liquidity.\n\nIncreased volatility as large institutional investors adjust their portfolios.\n\nPressure on asset valuations, particularly if the trend of divestment continues.\n\n\nThis development underscores the importance of monitoring institutional investment behaviors, as they can serve as early indicators of broader market sentiment shifts.\n\n[Financial Times - Paywalled](https://www.ft.com/content/6eea2278-556a-4395-9f6a-42cf2c6c2363)\n\n---\n\nAddendum 9: Yellen Just Sounded the Alarm - 14th of April\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has now publicly acknowledged what this thread has been screaming for days:\n\n&gt; “The selloff in Treasuries is very worrisome, especially in light of Trump’s tariff policies.”\n—Yellen, via [The Hill](https://thehill.com/business/5247789-yellen-dollar-based-assets-trump-tariff-policies/)\n\n\nThe top financial officer in the United States just admitted the core pillar of American finance—its ability to sell debt—is under threat. Not due to inflation. Not due to organic rate shifts. But due to policy-induced trust collapse.\n\nYellen specifically pointed to:\n\nDollar-based assets losing appeal\n\nTariffs as a destabilizing force\n\nThe need to reassure foreign holders of U.S. debt\n\n\nThis is no longer a fringe take.\nThis is no longer speculative.\nThis is Treasury-confirmed systemic risk.\n\nAnd if she’s going public with it, you can bet the internal data looks even worse.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 10: China Is Building New Export Markets - 14th of April \n\nOn April 14, President Xi Jinping began a high-level tour of Southeast Asia, starting with Vietnam—formally aimed at \"regional cooperation,\" but practically a geoeconomic pivot away from U.S. dependency.\n\n&gt; The visit, [planned for weeks](https://www.reuters.com/world/vietnam-host-china-eu-leaders-coming-weeks-amid-us-tariff-risks-sources-say-2025-04-02/) and part of a wider trip in Southeast Asia, comes as Beijing faces 145% U.S. duties, while [Vietnam is negotiating](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-vietnam-agree-launch-trade-deal-talks-tariffs-paused-2025-04-10/) a reduction of threatened [U.S. tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) of 46% that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.”\n—[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-xi-meet-vietnam-leaders-kick-off-southeast-asia-tour-amid-us-tariffs-2025-04-14/) \n\n\nThis isn’t a courtesy call. It’s a strategic rerouting of export flow. And Vietnam, already a rising player in global manufacturing and trade logistics, is a perfect staging ground.\n\nWhat this signals:\n\nChina is not bluffing. \n\nOther markets are eager to absorb what the U.S. is pushing away.\n\nThe old global order—U.S.-centered, dollar-settled—is being actively re-engineered.\n\nChina doesn’t need to match tariffs with tariffs. It just needs to build alternatives—and that’s exactly what it’s doing.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 11: The Fed’s Independence Is on the Chopping Block - 14th of April \n\nOn April 14, it was confirmed that the White House will begin interviewing candidates for the next Federal Reserve Chair—months ahead of schedule.\n\n&gt; “The White House will start interviewing candidates for the next Fed Chair this fall.”\n—[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bessent-says-white-house-will-start-interviewing-candidates-next-fed-chair-this-2025-04-14/) \n\n\nLet’s not play coy: this isn’t just succession planning. It’s the next phase of institutional capture.\n\nThe Trump administration has made it clear—through both action and pattern—that it intends to fill the Fed with loyalists, not technocrats. Past appointments have been:\n\n-Underqualified\n\n-Short-lived\n\n-Routinely replaced by deeper loyalists when they showed even a shred of autonomy\n\n\nThis isn’t about rates. It’s about control over monetary levers in a time of financial strain.\n\nWhat this signals to the world:\n\n-U.S. monetary policy is no longer independent\n\n-Market signals may be overridden by political needs\n\n-The one institution still holding credibility with global investors is now up for grabs (don't forget that foreign leaders can openly bring DJT through his crypto and golden visa schemes)\n\nExpect international confidence in U.S. debt and the dollar to deteriorate further, not just because of market signals—but because the referee is being replaced by the player.\n\nThis isn’t just about inflation targeting or QT timelines.\nThis is about the collapse of central bank legitimacy in real time.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 12: U.S. Power Projection No Longer Feared - 16th of April \n\nIn a rare and sobering admission, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has confirmed what many outside the Pentagon have only speculated: the U.S. military’s strategic dominance is no longer guaranteed. In an interview, Hegseth stated that China’s hypersonic missile arsenal is capable of sinking all ten U.S. aircraft carriers within twenty minutes of conflict. This directly challenges the very foundation of U.S. power projection, which has, for decades, relied on carrier strike groups to enforce diplomatic and economic influence across the globe.\n\nHegseth went further, admitting that the United States “loses to China in every war game” currently run by the Pentagon. He characterized China’s military buildup not as defensive, but as explicitly designed to destroy the United States in a direct conflict. The failure, he claimed, lies within the U.S. military-industrial bureaucracy itself—too slow, too politicized, and too bloated to compete with China's rapid and strategically coherent expansion.\n\nThis isn't just a military problem. The credibility of U.S. deterrence underwrites the credibility of the U.S. dollar, the safety of U.S. Treasuries, and the assumption of global economic stability. If the world no longer believes the U.S. can protect trade routes, enforce treaties, or credibly deter a peer conflict, then the financial architecture built atop that assumption begins to wobble.\n\nWhat Yellen hinted at in her comments about declining confidence in dollar-based assets, Hegseth has now echoed in military terms: the U.S. is no longer seen as untouchable. The psychological moat that protected American hegemony is drying up in real time.\n\n[Yahoo news](https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-could-sink-entire-us-100124996.html)\n\n---\n\nThis is my final update. There are too many signals, too much news, and I simply can't keep up. Everything I am seeing reinforces my analysis, and it has gone on to become a mainstream talking point. \n\nI appreciate the awards, updoots, and comments.

          "content": "Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.\n\nThe chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThe selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. \n\nNvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”\n\nThe analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”\n\nBut after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.\n\nData center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.\n\nFor Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.\n\nNvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.\n\nThe sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.\n\n“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.\n\nNvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-sheds-almost-600-billion-in-market-cap-biggest-drop-ever.html",
