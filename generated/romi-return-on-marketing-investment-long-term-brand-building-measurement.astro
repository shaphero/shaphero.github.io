        "content": "What is ROMI in Marketing and Why It Matters for Your Business Many businesses depend on marketing, but how can you measure its success? Although counts like clicks, likes, and website visits are easy to track, they usually fall short of showing how truly marketing affects your bottom line. Return on marketing investment helps there. This article will guide you through what is ROMI , and how it&#8217;s calculated, and provide doable ideas for best optimizing your return. For smarter growth, businesses should match marketing objectives with financial objectives. What is ROMI in Marketing ? Understanding the Core Concept ROMI is a crucial metric that compares the income your marketing campaigns produce to the money you have paid for them. It shows businesses how well their marketing drives financial results. Tracking ROMI helps companies decide where to allocate their marketing budgets for the best effect. ROMI vs. ROI Marketing Metrics ROI assesses the overall profitability of an investment, while ROMI analyzes the effectiveness of your advertising spend. It lets you analyze, concerning the expenses involved, how well your marketing initiatives produce income. Marketing ROI is specifically designed to evaluate the effectiveness of your marketing performance to maximize your money. What is ROMI Short For? ROMI, meaning &#8220;Return on Marketing Investment&#8221;. By calculating ROMI businesses can better plan campaigns and allocate money. The ROMI Formula The formula for computing return on marketing investment is: (Revenue from Marketing – Marketing Costs) / Marketing Costs This formula gives a ratio or percentage that shows how profitable your marketing efforts are. Why ROMI is Crucial for Business Growth Beyond Vanity Metrics : The important outcomes — monetary returns — are measured using ROMI for clarity. It delves deeply into financial impact and transcends performance criteria based only on appearances. Optimizing Budget Allocation : With ROMI, you may prioritize high-performing campaigns and remove low-performing ones. Aligning Marketing Efforts with Revenue Goals : ROMI links marketing actions to revenue outcomes, connecting your marketing team and C-suite. Thus, everyone works toward the same financial goals. This helps justify marketing costs and gain support for future projects. Aiding Long-Term Planning : ROMI informs long-term marketing strategy, budgeting, and forecasting decisions. Tracking ROMI over time helps you spot patterns, understand audience behavior, and optimize efforts. Factors That Influence ROMI Marketing Strategy Alignment : Marketing efficiency affects ROMI. Optimizing marketing results requires targeting the correct audience and aligning with business goals. Customer Acquisition Cost : ROMI can suffer from high CAC. Maintaining lead quality and lowering acquisition expenses is key to profitability. Sales Conversion Rates : High-engagement, low-conversion campaigns may reduce ROI. Addressing buying barriers and improving customer experience boosts conversion rates. Channel Performance : Different channels produce different effects. Assessing each marketing platform&#8217;s success helps allocate investment to the best channels, enhancing ROMI. Retention and Customer Lifetime Value : One-time buyers are less valued than repeat customers. Low retention affects long-term income and ROMI. Budget Allocation and Optimization : Poorly allocated funds can cause overpaying on underperforming campaigns. Optimizing marketing spending for high-performing activities is crucial. How to Calculate ROMI: A Simple Breakdown Step-by-Step Formula : Find the Income brought about by particular marketing campaigns. Subtract Marketing Expenditures (ads, production). Divide the result by Marketing Costs. You might be wondering: What is a good ROMI percentage ? While anything below 100% indicates you&#8217;re operating at a loss, a ROMI above 100% means your efforts are profitable. Variables Affecting ROMI Accuracy Many factors can affect ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment) data, making it hard to quantify campaign performance. These contain: Incorrect revenue attribution : Failure to accurately attribute revenue to campaigns or channels can significantly under- or overestimate results. This usually results from too simple attribution models that neglect to follow multi-touch consumer paths. Misjudging lifetime customer value (LCV) : Businesses often underestimate or overestimate customers&#8217; long-term value, affecting ROMI. Accurate LCV measurement calls for continuous tracking of client loyalty, retention rates, and repeat business. Omitting indirect marketing effects : Brand recognition, customer perception, and trust are indirect effects of marketing initiatives. Though they might not generate income right away, these effects are vital for long-term business growth and should not be overlooked. External factors : Seasonal, economic, and market factors might affect campaign performance. A holiday season, for instance, can naturally increase sales, which makes it more difficult to separate the actual influence of your marketing activities. To acquire a more accurate ROMI calculation , track all relevant indicators, employ robust attribution models, and account for these variables in calculations. The complete strategy will enable you to maximize the next marketing strategies and show a better image of your marketing effectiveness. Boost Your ROMI: Strategies for Success 1. Leverage Data and Analytics Track campaign performance in real-time with comprehensive data. You can make quick decisions with accurate data on what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not. Tracking click-through rates, conversions, and ROI lets you optimize strategy and reduce waste. 2. Enhance Targeting Segment and personalize your audience to target the right customers. CRM tools and behavioral analytics can help you personalize content for engagement and conversions. 3. Optimize Marketing Funnels Streamline the sales funnel to eliminate customer journey drop-offs. Fix weak points like shopping cart abandonment and ad clicks by improving processes and calls to action. A seamless awareness-to-conversion path improves client acquisition and marketing ROI. 4. Test and Experiment Continuously A/B test campaigns, creatives, and messages to find audience favorites. Test headlines, images, and CTA placement to improve your strategy. Innovation from experimentation helps you remain ahead of the competition and increase efficiency. 5. Invest in Customer Retention Don&#8217;t ignore established consumers! Loyalty programs, better customer service, and personalized follow-ups may increase Customer Lifetime Value. Happy consumers are more likely to return and promote your business, enhancing your ROI. Common Mistakes in ROMI Analysis and How to Avoid Them Focusing Only on Short-Term Results How to Avoid : Analyze short- and long-term data. CLV can measure the long-term impact of your campaigns. Using Incorrect or Incomplete Data How to Avoid: Audit your data sources regularly to verify accuracy, reliability, and completeness. Examine data with modern analytics tools. Neglecting Attribution Models Avoid single-point-of-contact attribution models and use multi-touch attribution models to determine conversion pathways. Overlooking Indirect Benefits of Marketing How to Avoid : In addition to direct revenue, analyze qualitative indicators and indirect benefits. Failing to Segment and Analyze Different Audiences How to Avoid : For complex insights and personalized marketing tactics, segment your target audience by demographics, behavior, or other variables. Businesses can improve their ROMI analysis and create better marketing initiatives by recognizing and resolving these typical mistakes. What is One Drawback of Auditing a Firm Using ROMI? Auditing a business with ROMI makes attribution difficult. Complex multi-touchpoint client journeys make it challenging to assign marketing efforts specific value. Customer interactions may include social media, email campaigns, and sponsored ads before converting. It can be difficult to determine which channel caused the conversion. Complexity can skew analytics and undermine a campaign&#8217;s performance.

Analytics Tools HubSpot and Google Analytics provide built-in ROMI features to help marketers measure marketing performance and track income in real time. These tools offer dashboards and statistics on performance data to assist companies make decisions and optimize strategies. Proper Attribution Models Effective attribution models like multi-touch attribution account for all consumer interactions that contribute to revenue goals. Multi-touch attribution helps marketers allocate ad spending by showing how different marketing channels and activities work together rather than merely crediting the first or last touchpoint. This method avoids simplistic tracking and provides customer behavior insights. Automation and AI Automation technologies can crunch data, generate reports, and predict performance. They simplify operations and let marketers focus on strategy and creative problem-solving rather than spreadsheets. AI may also analyze large volumes of data, find patterns, and suggest ROMI optimizations. Modern marketers use AI to improve ad targeting and personalize customer experiences. Continuous Testing Regular A/B testing lets companies compare strategies, methods, and creative elements to see which works best.

With marketing channels multiplying, it can be hard to understand the impact of channel choice and investments on brand equity and sales. Return on marketing investments (ROMI) is an essential metric to measure. It lets you know how effective your marketing activities are and can provide the data to help improve efforts. The challenge is knowing how to do this effectively. ROI vs ROMI Before we get into the specifics of ROMI it’s important to differentiate it from return on investment (ROI). ROI is a measure of the monetary value of an investment, any investment. When looking at the ROI meaning in marketing, you are thinking specifically of marketing ROI or ROMI which measures the specific monetary value of marketing investments or campaigns. How to calculate marketing ROI A brand’s return on marketing investment is, quite simply, how much money they get back compared to the costs involved. To calculate marketing ROI, you take the sales growth (the profit), subtract marketing costs, and then divide by the marketing costs. When it comes to ROMI calculation, it’s important to assess the effectiveness of marketing activities in general, and through specific channels. Calculating ROMI allows marketers to: Evaluate marketing campaign performance ROMI is one of the key performance indicators for marketing efforts. It allows you to evaluate the success (or lack of) for marketing campaigns. Get a better idea of where to spend money The return on marketing investment will highlight which channels are doing well, and which may need more – or less – of a focus. Marketers are able to view the channels and campaigns that drive the most profit and direct more attention to these avenues. Effectively review future marketing budgets Once you know which channels and campaigns drive the most profit, you can plan future marketing budgets around this. Also, a bigger return on marketing investment may result in leadership allocating more money for future campaigns. But calculating ROMI is not without its challenges which include: Measuring the right metrics What are key performance indicators in marketing? What metrics should marketers focus on? Multiple touchpoints As well as knowing which metrics to evaluate, it’s also challenging to know which touchpoints to attribute to sales. During a consumer’s path to purchase, they will likely be exposed to, and interact with, multiple touchpoints and so knowing exactly how much value can be allocated to each touchpoint is hard. Making sense of the data With many different channels and touchpoints, there can be a mass of data to sort through, not all of it easily comparable. It can be hard to cut through the noise and highlight the key areas of focus. How to measure return on marketing investments To tap into the opportunity and overcome the challenges, it’s important for marketers to implement best-practices in measurement. These include: Agree on the metrics you’re tracking As we’ve seen, measuring ROMI can be a useful way to plan future campaigns and allocate budget. But this is only helpful if the right metrics are being assessed. Focusing on metrics that will add value to your brand and help it grow are the key to justifying marketing spend. Look at both short-term and long-term goals A brand’s return on marketing investment often excludes longer-term results. Because of this, focusing solely on your ROMI can create a fallacy of growth that comes at the expense of long-term brand building. So, it’s important for brands to not focus solely on this metric, but instead, to look at it as part of a broader picture in order to plan and track for brand growth . Understand attribution models In an environment where marketing channels are multiplying, understanding the impact of channel choices and investments on both brand equity and sales has become an even greater challenge. Without the ability to quickly quantify which channels – or mix of channels – provide desired outcomes, strategic planning and budget allocation lose accuracy. As a result, it's possible to rely too much on measurable marketing channels for decision-making and investment. One way to tackle these challenges, and to follow best practice around measurement, is to have a comprehensive and easy-to-use marketing analytics software plan in place. Total Marketing ROI , which provides a comprehensive assessment of marketing ROI, measures short and long-term impact of marketing on both sales and brand equity. Our Kantar marketing analytics software allows marketers to better make decision by providing a deeper understanding of the relative contribution of marketing assets, and is globally scalable, delivering consistent outputs across markets and brands. How to improve your return on marketing investments Through marketing, brands inevitably want to optimize investments to increase demand . So, how should you do this? Set goals – and constantly work towards them If you want to improve something, you must first set tangible goals – and then make sure your actions are driven by a desire to achieve them. Make goals specific, set deadlines, and – most importantly – make them achievable. Keep long-term goals in mind When setting your marketing KPIs, it can be easy to get swept away in the short-term wins, but, as we have seen, this can be detrimental to long-term brand goals. Make sure that overall brand growth is front of mind when setting and implementing your goals and consider how tools such as a marketing KPI dashboard can help maintain transparency of data. Experiment with A/B testing The best way to know which channel or method delivers the biggest ROI is to test them out. A/B testing is a simple and effective way to compare campaign strategies and channels. It may feel like you aren’t making any gains in the short-term but figuring out what works best for you brand will help deliver those long-term goals. Implement the right marketing analytics software and track KPIs When you’re unsure how to set KPIs for marketing, testing different campaign types is tempting. This strategy will only deliver results if you have the right systems in place to track their progress, though. Making sure you select a platform that helps you gain deeper validation of marketing investment decisions through fast, quantifiable results will inevitably help improve ROMI. You should now have a better idea of how to calculate marketing ROI, and the best ways to measure and improve your return on investments. The best way to improve ways of working is to get a plan in place and then make good on those plans. Get in touch to see how Kantar Analytics can help deliver easy, actionable insights.

        "content": "What is Marketing ROI and How Do You Calculate It? Marketing Evolution Published July 20, 2022 Share this blog post on Twitter Share this blog post on Facebook Share this blog post on LinkedIn One of the most important components of a marketing campaign is to evaluate its performance and impact and profit so that it can be determined whether or not your marketing efforts are actually helping the company improve its bottom line. The insights gained through the process can be used to drive future, data-driven strategies for smarter decision-making. Let’s explore the concept of return on investment (ROI) in marketing: What is ROI in Marketing? Marketing ROI is the practice of attributing profit and revenue growth to the impact of marketing initiatives. By calculating return on marketing investment, organizations can measure the degree to which marketing efforts either holistically, or on a campaign-basis, contribute to revenue growth. Typically, marketing ROI is used to justify marketing spend and budget allocation for ongoing and future campaigns and initiatives. How is Marketing ROI Used by Companies? At an organizational level, calculating return on marketing investment can help guide business decisions and optimize marketing efforts. For marketers, understanding the ROI generated by a campaign helps: Justify Marketing Spend CMOs consistently list allocating resources and budget for marketing efforts as a top priority.However, in order to secure budget and resources for future campaigns, it’s crucial that current marketing spend and budget be justified at the executive level. To do so, marketers need to accurately calculate the ROI their marketing efforts are delivering for the organization. For example, they should know if native ads are driving conversions and ROI, while display ads fall flat. From there, budgets can be properly allocated. Distribute Marketing Budgets Across online and offline channels , there’s a myriad of possible marketing mix combinations. However, any combination of campaign initiatives require funding. That’s why understanding which online and offline efforts drive the most revenue is a must for properly distributing the marketing budget. Measure Campaign Success and Establish Baselines A crucial part of any successful marketing team is the ability to measure campaign success and establish baselines that can serve as a reference for future efforts. With this in mind, accurately measuring ROI helps marketers do both. By understanding the impact of individual campaigns on overall revenue growth, marketers can better identify the right mix of offline and online campaign efforts. Moreover, measuring ROI consistently allows marketers to establish baselines to quickly gauge their success and adjust efforts in order to maximize impact. Competitive Analysis Tracking the marketing ROI of competitors allows marketers to accurately understand how their organization is performing within their specific industry. For example, marketers tracking publicly available financial data can estimate the ROI of competitors and adjust baselines to reflect these estimates—helping to keep efforts consistently competitive. How Do You Calculate / Measure Marketing ROI? While there are several different ways to calculate marketing ROI, the core formula used to understand marketing impact at a high-level is relatively straightforward: (Sales Growth - Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost = Marketing ROI It’s important to note, however, that this formula makes the assumption that all sales growth is tied to marketing efforts. In order to generate a more realistic view of marketing impact and ROI, marketers should account for organic sales. (Sales Growth - Organic Sales Growth - Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost = Marketing ROI When leveraging marketing ROI formulas, it’s also important to understand the total ROI marketing efforts have generated. Be aware that definitions for an actionable “return” can vary based on the marketing team’s strategy and campaign efforts, as well as general overhead related to campaign implementation. Let’s explore some key elements to factor into your marketing ROI calculations: Total Revenue : By looking at the total revenue generated from a particular campaign, marketers can gain a clear holistic overview of their efforts. Accounting for total revenue when measuring marketing ROI is ideal for strategic media planning , budget allocation and overall marketing impact. Gross Profit : Tying in gross profit helps marketers understand the total revenue that marketing efforts generate in relation to the cost of production or delivery of goods and services. To do this, marketers should add the following to their marketing ROI formula: = (Total revenue - cost of goods to deliver a product) . Net Profit: Diving deeper, marketers can calculate the impact of their marketing efforts toward net profit by adding the following to their formula: = (Gross profit - additional expenses) . It’s important to consistently define what profit/expenditures and overall ROI your team will account for across marketing ROI measurement efforts. Consider including the following: Overhead and internal expenses Agency fees Media buys Creative Marketers can also calculate ROI through customer lifetime value (CLV), which sheds light on the value of each individual customer relationship with a brand. This formula helps assess long-term ROI across the consumer’s lifecycle. To do this, marketers can use the following formula: Customer Lifetime Value = (Retention Rate)/ (1 + Discount Rate/ Retention Rate) What is a Good Marketing ROI? The rule of thumb for marketing ROI is typically a 5:1 ratio , with exceptional ROI being considered at around a 10:1 ratio . Anything below a 2:1 ratio is considered not profitable, as the costs to produce and distribute goods/services often mean organizations will break even with their spend and returns. However, costs and overhead lower than 50 percent of the sales price can see profits on their efforts at lower ratios. Because every organization is different, it’s important to consider the unique overhead costs, margins, and industry factors and standards unique to the sector. What Are the Challenges of Measuring Marketing ROI? The calculations needed to measure marketing ROI may seem simple, but they can quickly become complex and layered. Consider the following: Marketing Measurements are Too Simplistic In order to evaluate true marketing ROI, there are many factors to consider. Primarily, there should be a clear and consistent sales baseline for marketers to measure against. Additionally, ROI measurements should account for external factors that impact campaign success, including weather, seasonal trends, events, etc. Marketers are Focused on Short-Term Results M any marketers focus on specific, immediate metrics to gauge the success of their efforts. All too often, we look at click-through rates, impressions, social shares, etc. However, campaigns focused on driving long-term initiatives like brand awareness , customer relationships or customer retention often take months or years before marketers can see the full impact. With this in mind, it’s important to align success metrics with the overall goal and duration of a given campaign. The Marketing Landscape is Omnichannel Today’s omnichannel campaigns aren’t limited to a specific channel, but a number of touchpoints across online and offline channels. Focusing marketing ROI measurements on specific channels will only provide marketers with pieces of the overall marketing impact puzzle. Now, accurate marketing ROI measurement relies on unified marketing measurements capable of aligning disparate measurements into cohesive, granular insights. Multiple Touchpoints Before the Purchase It takes, on average, 6-10 touchpoints before a consumer reaches a buying decision. In order to truly measure marketing ROI at the granular level, marketers need to understand the impact of online and offline touchpoints across the marketing mix. The relationship between these touchpoints in the sales funnel also need to be accounted for when measuring marketing returns. Outdated Attribution Models As marketers measure and attribute the impact of touchpoints and channels, using outdated attribution models can lead to misattribution, which can skew the accuracy of ROI measurements. Leveraging aggregate measurements like media mix models will not provide the granular insights marketers need. On the flipside, granular measurements like multi-touch attribution models will not indicate the impact offline channels and external factors have on marketing ROI. Tips for Improving Marketing ROI Now that you’re aware of the concept of marketing ROI and what a good ROI in marketing is, the next step is to begin applying insights learned to future marketing efforts to optimize future performance. Let’s take a look at a few tips for improving ROI for long-term marketing success : 1. Establish Clear Goals In the book, What Sticks: Why Most Advertising Fails and How to Guarantee Yours Succeeds , Rex Briggs coined the term \"ROMO'' for Return-On-Marketing-Objective. Alternative to marketing-return-on-investment (ROMI), tThis term uncovers the notion that there can be more to a campaign than just ROI, such as changing brand or perception. With this in mind, it’s crucial for marketers to establish clear goals that indicate what external factors make up their ROMOs, as well as how these unique factors can be measured (and subsequently applied to marketing ROI calculation). Consider leveraging measurements like brand awareness strategy surveys, social platform engagements, or the ratio between MQLs and SQLs. 2. Determine Costs Establishing marketing costs like creative development, personnel, agency fees, overhead, among others, can help marketers clearly formulate their marketing ROI measurement strategies and decide on what metrics to include in their ROI calculations. 3. Leverage a Marketing Analytics Platform Utilizing the right attribution models and marketing measurement strategies works wonders to track consumers across the omnichannel landscape, leading to clearer holistic and granular results. Focus on a marketing technology platform with the capability to unify disparate attributions alongside online and offline measurements. Armed with an analytics tool like the Marketing Evolution Platform , marketers will have clearer insights to use in their formulas—leading to more efficient and accurate ROI measurement.

A B2B company analyzed their customer journey and found that while social media created awareness, email and content marketing drove 73% of their qualified leads, leading to a strategic shift in their channel prioritization.\n\n# How can I measure the ROI of my diversified digital strategy?\n\nModern measurement approaches provide clear insights:\n\n* Implementing unified tracking across channels\n* Developing multi-touch attribution models\n* Conducting controlled experiments with defined variables\n* Analyzing customer journey data for influence points\n* Measuring lifetime value differences by channel\n* Implementing incrementality testing\n* Conducting customer surveys on influence factors\n\nA technology company implemented comprehensive tracking and discovered their diversified strategy generated a 347% ROI when all influenced conversions were properly attributed, compared to the 42% ROI they had previously calculated using last-touch attribution.\n\n# How do I balance innovation with proven approaches?\n\nEffective balancing strategies include:\n\n* Implementing the 70/20/10 rule (70% proven, 20% evolving, 10% experimental)\n* Creating innovation testing frameworks and processes\n* Developing clear success metrics for new approaches\n* Starting with small-scale pilots before scaling\n* Learning from early adopters in your industry\n* Creating dedicated innovation budgets and resources\n* Developing a culture of controlled experimentation\n\nA retail business implemented a structured innovation program with dedicated resources and clear evaluation criteria.

This approach built a database of 47,000 qualified prospects within 12 months, providing a foundation for personalized marketing independent of third-party data.\n\n# How do I create an effective omnichannel experience?\n\nKey elements for successful implementation:\n\n* Starting with comprehensive customer journey mapping\n* Developing consistent data collection across touchpoints\n* Creating unified customer profiles and views\n* Implementing cross-channel messaging consistency\n* Developing channel-specific optimizations within framework\n* Creating seamless transitions between channels\n* Implementing unified measurement and attribution\n\nA financial services company implemented a systematic approach to omnichannel experience development, starting with journey mapping and building connected systems. This methodology improved their customer satisfaction scores by 43% and increased their conversion rates by 37% through more cohesive experiences.\n\n# How do I prepare for emerging technologies without overcommitting?\n\nBalanced approaches to innovation:\n\n* Developing systematic technology evaluation frameworks\n* Creating small-scale pilot programs for testing\n* Participating in partner beta programs\n* Implementing modular technology architecture\n* Focusing on use cases rather than technologies\n* Building internal knowledge and capabilities gradually\n* Creating strategic roadmaps with flexibility\n\nA retail company implemented a structured approach to emerging technology adoption, using small pilots and clear success criteria. This methodology allowed them to successfully implement three new technologies that delivered significant competitive advantage, while avoiding costly investments in eight others that showed limited potential.\n\n# How do I build internal capabilities for advanced digital marketing?\n\nStrategic capability development approaches:\n\n* Assessing current skills and identifying gaps\n* Developing phased training and development programs\n* Creating centers of excellence for key capabilities\n* Implementing knowledge sharing and documentation\n* Balancing in-house development with external partners\n* Creating continuous learning frameworks\n* Developing recruitment strategies for critical skills\n\nA B2B company implemented a comprehensive digital capability development program, systematically building expertise in key areas. This approach improved their marketing performance by 47% while reducing their dependency on agencies by 34%, creating significant cost savings and competitive advantage.\n\n# How do I convince leadership to invest in digital transformation?\n\nEffective approaches for securing buy-in:\n\n* Developing clear business cases with ROI projections\n* Creating phased implementation plans with milestones\n* Implementing small-scale pilots to demonstrate value\n* Benchmarking against competitors and industry leaders\n* Highlighting risks of maintaining status quo\n* Creating executive education and awareness programs\n* Developing comprehensive measurement frameworks\n\nA professional services firm developed a compelling business case for digital transformation with clear financial projections and competitive analysis. This structured approach secured a $1.2 million investment that delivered a 347% ROI within 18 months through improved marketing performance and operational efficiency.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe future of digital marketing lies not in dependency on any single platform or channel, but in developing diversified, integrated strategies that leverage multiple touchpoints while maintaining control of key assets and data. By implementing strategic diversification, developing omnichannel approaches, and leveraging predictive analytics, businesses can create resilient marketing ecosystems that deliver superior results regardless of platform-specific changes.\n\nAs social media platforms continue to experience challenges with organic reach, increasing costs, and consumer trust, forward-thinking marketers are building balanced digital portfolios that combine owned, earned, and paid media in strategic proportions. This approach not only improves performance but also creates sustainable competitive advantage through greater control and adaptability.\n\nAs you develop your future-focused digital marketing strategy, remember these core principles:\n\n1. Build owned digital assets and first-party data as your foundation\n2. Create seamless, integrated experiences across all customer touchpoints\n3. Implement data-driven decision making with predictive capabilities\n4. Balance proven approaches with controlled innovation\n5. Develop internal capabilities for key digital marketing functions\n\nBy following these principles and implementing the strategies outlined in this article, you'll be well-positioned to thrive in the evolving digital landscape—creating sustainable marketing success regardless of how individual platforms or channels may change.\n\n# More Articles For You\n\n* **…**[AI Apps Empire: AI That Turns Any Idea Into an AI App — 100% White-Labelled &amp; Ready to Sell in Just 60 Seconds!](https://softtechhub.us/2025/04/04/ai-apps-empire/)\n* **…**[Land a Higher Paying Data Job: Master Data Engineering and Start Earning **$94k – $730k / year** ](https://softtechhub.us/dataengineeracademy)\n* **…**[Introducing ‘Video Script Pro GPT’: an AI-driven video script writing tool with PLR rights, enabling customers to sell the scripts as their own and retain 100% of the profits](https://softtechhub.us/2025/04/04/introducing-video-script-pro-gpt/)\n* **…**[OriginSuite Review: Powerful AI-Powered All-in-One Marketing Suite That Replaces GoHighLevel, ClickFunnels, Kajabi &amp; More–For A Low, One-Time Fee](https://softtechhub.us/2025/04/03/originsuite-review-ai-powered/)\n* **…**[Maximizing Amazon Review Generation with Helium 10’s Review Automation Tools](https://softtechhub.us/2025/04/03/maximizing-amazon-review-generation/)\n* **…**[Boosting Amazon Sales with Helium 10’s Market Tracker: Competitive Intelligence for Sellers](https://softtechhub.us/2025/04/03/boosting-amazon-sales-with-helium-10/)",

        "content": "&gt;President Donald Trump called for ending a bipartisan $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program that’s spurred more than $400 billion in investments from companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp.\n\n&gt;“Your Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing,” the president said in a prime-time address to Congress on Tuesday. Trump implored US House Speaker Mike Johnson to get rid of the legislation and use “whatever is left over” to “reduce debt or any other reason.”\n\n&gt;His remarks were met with applause in a chamber that passed the Chips and Science Act less than three years ago. Vice President JD Vance, whose home state of Ohio won a massive Intel project thanks to the law, stood up to show his support for its revocation.\n\n&gt;The Chips Act is among the most significant US forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. It set aside $39 billion in grants — plus loans and 25% tax breaks — to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $11 billion for chip research and development. The aim was to reduce reliance on Asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centers.\n\n&gt;Trump, however, has consistently derided a program he regards as a waste of government funds, arguing tariffs would achieve the same outcome while filling coffers. Republicans have also indicated that they want to repeal what they see as “social” provisions of the Chips Act. That could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements.\n\n&gt;Officials on both sides of the aisle have touted the Chips Act as crucial to US national and economic security, and Trump could have a hard time getting congressional support to repeal it. Dozens of GOP lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law.\n\n&gt;That includes South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., which have committed to multibillion-dollar projects in Texas and Indiana that were contingent on funding and support from the US government. Company representatives declined to comment on the president’s remarks.\n\n&gt;Trump, favoring tariffs over incentives, has signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month. Companies can avoid those duties, he has said, by building factories on American soil. He has not offered additional details.\n\n&gt;On Monday, Trump credited the tariff threats for TSMC’s decision to invest $100 billion in the US, on top of a previous $65 billion commitment. He touted that project in his address Tuesday, referencing the full $165 billion figure. “We’re giving them no money,” Trump said. “All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs.”\n\n&gt;A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment.\n\n&gt;The company originally announced plans for a $12 billion US site during Trump’s first term and expanded that project to three factories under Biden. To support those facilities, TSMC struck an agreement with Biden officials for $6.6 billion in Chips Act grants and $5 billion in loans.\n\n&gt;As is the case for other Chips Act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as TSMC hits negotiated project milestones. The company received $1.5 billion before Biden left office.\n\n&gt;Trump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that’s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives to which the government has already committed, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker’s latest investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the newly announced projects — three additional chip plants, plus R&amp;D and advanced packaging sites — won’t win federal funds.\n\n&gt;“The main uncertainty is the future of TSMC,” said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. “One long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in Taiwan, where labor costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. It’s completely different in the US if they are to shift more manufacturing. Subsidies from US were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.”\n\n&gt;TSMC is among 20 companies that reached binding Chips Act agreements with Biden officials. The deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the program, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc. — as well as older-generation factories by the likes of GlobalFoundries Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.\n\n&gt;Companies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad — regardless of who’s in office. But some of them have worried that the Trump administration could seek to modify the terms, Bloomberg has reported. Lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first.\n\n&gt;That review is ongoing, and Lutnick’s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. So far, his questions to program staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government’s legal authority to claw money back, Bloomberg has reported. The current Chips Act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive.\n\n&gt;A spokesperson for GlobalWafers Co., which won $406 million from the Chips Act for factories in Texas and Missouri, said the Taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the Chips Act as “unlikely.”\n\n&gt;But if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, “we would reassess future investments, including evaluating US market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the US.”\n\n**My take:** Brutally bad for semiconductor sector if CHIPS is actually repealed, INTC is especially targeted. There'd be less semiconductor manufacturing in the US (INTC/TSM/Samsung) primarily because we subsidize and have tax incentives for current US chip manfacturing projects, and companies that haven't received their funding will likely scale back projects [(remember INTC delayed their Ohio plant to 2028?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0cq51/intel_delays_28_billion_ohio_chip_factory_in_new/). The US would also be far more dependent on semiconductor production overseas. \n\nThis also has spillover into the quantum computing stocks (IONQ/RGTI) and AI sector due to the sectors being so reliant on technological development and supply from the semis sectors.\n\nOverall don't think new tariffs are going to be an adequate replacement for what the US has committed so far (but we don't know much about  the tariffs yet), and the markets hate uncertainty.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-calls-for-end-to-52-billion-chips-act-subsidy-program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-calls-for-end-to-52-billion-chips-act-subsidy-program)",

And the U.S. Treasury market—the holy grail of global finance—isn’t bulletproof anymore.**\n\n**Let’s recap:**\n\n* **Japan started quietly dumping Treasuries.** Data from Japan's Ministry of Finance indicates that Japanese investors were net sellers of foreign bonds in the week ending April 5, 2025, marking a significant shift in their investment behavior. [www.fxstreet.com](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-kato-says-will-not-sell-us-treasury-holdings-just-from-standpoint-of-us-japan-relations-202504090051)\n* **China responded to tariffs by not escalating—a silence that screamed “we’re ready.”** China's measured response to the U.S. tariffs suggests strategic positioning rather than immediate retaliation. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/09/dramatic-sell-off-of-us-government-bonds-as-tariff-war-panic-deepens)\n* **Japan, South Korea, and China began coordinating trade and financial policy.** Reports indicate that these nations have engaged in discussions to align their economic strategies in response to U.S. trade policies. [www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/japan/japans-ruling-camp-call-sales-tax-cut-yomiuri-reports-2025-04-10/)\n* **Canada issued a $3.5B USD bond, signaled reserve repositioning, and quietly hinted at coordinated selling.** Mark Carney didn’t even have to raise his voice—just moved a piece on the board and let the pressure rise. [www.snopes.com/](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/11/canada-mark-carney-treasurys-sell-off/)\n* **Bond yields exploded. Liquidity evaporated.** The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly surpassed 5%, reaching levels not seen since late 2023, signaling a significant drop in demand. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/09/dramatic-sell-off-of-us-government-bonds-as-tariff-war-panic-deepens)\n* **The Fed muttered, “we’ll stabilize markets if needed.”** This statement indicates the Federal Reserve's readiness to intervene in the markets to maintain stability amid the volatility. [www.theaustralian.com.au](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/how-the-bond-market-scared-trump-into-action/news-story/6b1db0612fbd5cfcbbc1cb5e313d1ecc)\n\nAll of this points to one thing:  \n**This is no longer about interest rates or inflation. This is a trust war.**  \nAnd trust—not tanks—is what backs the U.S. dollar.\n\n**Here’s what I didn’t get to post:**\n\n**The infrastructure broke.**  \nThe system cracked under the pressure.\n\nAccording to [Risk.net](http://Risk.net), over $2 trillion in U.S. Treasuries were traded per day during the height of the tariff fallout—double the average daily volume. [www.risk.net (Paywalled)](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7961376/treasury-selloff-challenges-back-office-systems)\n\nFIS and Trading Technologies—core post-trade platforms used by major brokerages—experienced significant processing delays due to the unprecedented trade volumes.\n\nThis wasn’t Reddit lagging under upvotes. This was the **clearing layer of the bond market going offline.**\n\nThat’s the nightmare:  \nA liquidity shock colliding with a back-office failure.  \nIt creates a bottleneck that spirals into **margin calls, repo freezes, counterparty chaos**, and then—  \n*maybe*—an actual market halt.\n\nAnd what happened right after?  \n**A surprise tariff exemption.**\n\n**Which brings me to the biggest tell of all: the walkback.**\n\nTrump spent days imposing 125% tariffs. Then suddenly:\n\n**He backs off. Quietly. Subtly. A pause. A delay. A face-saving half-reversal.**\n\n[content.govdelivery.com](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCBP/bulletins/3db9e55)\n\n**Why?**  \nBecause **the bond market screamed.**  \nBecause **Japan’s selling worked.**  \nBecause **the Treasury floor buckled—and the White House blinked.**\n\nThat tariff exemption **validates everything**:\n\n* If the tariffs were effective, there would be no need to flinch.\n* If China, Japan, or others weren’t leveraging their holdings, there’d be no fear.\n* If the Treasury market wasn’t exposed, the Fed wouldn’t have signaled intervention.\n\nThis was a **geopolitical stress test**—and the U.S. didn’t pass.  \nIt limped across the finish line.\n\n**So what now?**\n\nThis is the **foundation** under your economy catching fire.  \nAnd the Fed just checked the beams and heard them **hollow.**\n\nIf you missed the original post, I’ve reuploaded it onto my profile [An idiot's Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMysteryCheese/comments/1jxxss9/the_fed_just_blinked_china_is_about_to_nuke_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1).\n\nIf you’re a mod, just admit it rattled you.

And while the headlines talk about jobs and inflation, the only real debate in Washington was: who gets bailed out and how?\n\nTrump’s “solution” is now playing out. And what it will unleash is:\n\n-Mass unemployment\n\n-Mortgage defaults\n\n-Credit card delinquencies\n\n-Student loan defaults\n\n-Personal bankruptcies\n\nThere is a bubble in personal consumer debt\n\n---\n\nAddendum 2: Margin Calls and Domestic Liquidity Fragility\n\nu/im_a_squishy_ai built on the analysis above, it’s not just foreign selling that's stressing the bond market—the domestic side is breaking too.\n\nMargin calls started going out to hedge funds on the first Thursday and Friday of the selloff. These weren’t triggered by any deep fundamental devaluation of equities—they were triggered simply because valuations reverted to a historical norm.\n\n&gt;Stocks fell to 15–20x forward earnings—which is textbook fair value. That’s not a crash. That’s a mean reversion.\n\nAnd yet, it triggered margin calls.\n\nThat tells us something:\nHedge funds are so over-leveraged that even a return to normal valuations creates a liquidity crisis. There is no buffer. There is no margin for error. No resilience.\n\nThis means this is another bubble—plain and simple. A structurally fragile one.\n\nAs the real economy begins to absorb job losses, business failures, declining earnings, and reduced consumer demand—all natural consequences of the tariff and credit tightening cycle—those margin calls are going to accelerate.\n\nThe market has already shown its hand:\n\n&gt;Just normalizing destabilizes it.\n\nBut we’re not heading for normal. We’re heading for a deterioration.\nAnd that means the next wave of selling won’t be orderly—it’ll be forced. Liquidations. Defaults. Fire sales.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 3: The Commercial Real Estate Time Bomb\n\nu/Pietes highlighted another structural fault line we need to talk about, commercial real estate—and specifically the overvaluation and fragility of REITs.\n\nMost commercial real estate isn’t bought outright. It’s acquired using loan-like financing structures, often leveraged against stock-based collateral or a fragile web of interconnected property portfolios. It’s a Jenga tower of credit assumptions—and all it takes is one piece to wobble.\n\nREITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are the largest holders of both commercial and residential real estate in the U.S. They are heavily dependent on valuation stability and rental yield expectations—both of which are at risk in the current macro environment.\n\nIn a scenario of rising rates, job losses, and liquidity-driven asset fire sales, REITs become amplifiers of systemic risk.\n\nIf the market faces renewed margin calls, and REIT valuations slip even modestly, their leverage unwinds\n\nIf property vacancies rise from business closures or consumer retrenchment, their cash flows evaporate\n\nAnd if broader financial players start selling REITs or their underlying mortgage-backed assets to meet liquidity demands, we’re looking at contagion across multiple sectors\n\nIn short: REITs are sitting on illiquid assets funded by borrowed optimism.\nIn a liquidity crunch, optimism is the first thing to vanish.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 4 : The Domestic Bank Run\n\nAs per u/Boobpocket on my original post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/s/2LMdR3Z3AQ\n\nThe recent policy move to freeze immigrant bank accounts is a potential flashpoint—and one that could blindside the financial system.\n\nIf even a fraction of the 15+ million account holders rush to withdraw their funds in fear of asset seizure or financial isolation, it could trigger a silent bank run.\n\nThis isn’t a regional bank failure or a crypto contagion. This is distributed, fragmented, and unpredictable—across every major bank and financial institution in the country.\n\nYou’re talking about:\n\nMass withdrawals\n\nLiquidity pressures\n\nForced reserve drawdowns\n\nPotential failures of smaller or mid-tier institutions\n\nAnd a surge in cash hoarding and offshore transfers that destabilizes confidence in retail banking itself\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether the policy gets enforced.\nThe fear alone, the signal it sends can do the damage.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 5: Trump Walks Back the Tariff Exemptions—Sort Of - 13th of April \n\nThere’s not much meat to this one yet, but it’s worth noting:\n\nTrump just called the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's own tariff guidance update—the one that signaled a soft exemption for Chinese chip imports—“fake news” on Truth Social.\n\n&gt; Yes, he’s calling his own administration’s federal directive fake.\n\nMake of that what you will.\nIs it a power struggle inside the executive? A tactic to confuse markets? Or just another moment of chaos-as-strategy?\n\nWhatever it is, it reintroduces uncertainty into a market that has barely begun to stabilize.\n\n\n[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/13/tariffs-chips-lutnick/)\n\n---\n\nAddendum 6: China Halts Exports of Rare Earth Minerals - 13th of April \n\nChina just put the brakes on one of the most strategically vital trade flows in the modern economy: rare earth minerals and magnets.\n\n&gt; “It will take 45 days before export licenses could be issued and exports... would resume,”\n—Michael Silver, CEO of American Elements (via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html))\n\n\nThis move can be read two ways—and both are bad for the U.S.:\n1. It’s a flex.\nChina is leveraging its chokehold on critical materials—used in everything from EVs to military hardware—to apply economic pressure in response to tariffs and bond hostility.\n\n2. It’s a mirror.\nChina is reminding the world that they are the factory, the mine, and the magnet. This isn’t just retaliation. It’s a demonstration of structural leverage. They don’t need to escalate. They just need to remind everyone how replaceable the U.S. is in the supply chain, and how irreplaceable China remains.\n\nEither way, this is a strategic maneuver, not a tantrum.\nAnd it just added more fuel to an already burning trust crisis in the U.S. financial leadership.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 7: Subprime Auto Loans\n\nu/ClicheCrime brings up the subprime auto loan industry, currently operating on borrowed time and collapsing collateral.\n\nCar values are plummeting as supply chain normalization floods the used market.\n\nBorrowers are underwater on high-interest loans, many with zero equity.\n\nDefaults are climbing, repo rates are spiking, and entire ABS (asset-backed securities) chains are quietly fraying.\n\nThis is 2008 subprime mortgages, but on wheels and with no bailout narrative.\n\nCars aren’t just assets. They’re lifelines.\nIn much of the U.S., no car means no job. There’s no public transport net to catch these people.\n\nSo what happens when millions lose access to work, default, and spiral into personal insolvency?\n\nNo car, no job.\nNo job, no payments.\nNo payments, no stability.\n\n[www.creditchronometer.com](https://www.creditchronometer.com/subprime-auto-is-there-a-bad-moon-on-the-rise)\n\n---\n\nAddendum 8: Foreign Pensions Begin Pullback from U.S. Equities - 14th of April \n\nOn April 14, reports emerged that major Danish and Canadian pension funds are actively reassessing and, in some cases, reducing their investments in U.S. equities due to escalating geopolitical tensions and market instability.\n\n- Denmark's PFA, the country's largest pension fund, has been reducing its overweight in equities over the past month, citing increasing uncertainty stemming from recent trade policies and market volatility .\n\n- Canadian pension funds are also pausing new investments in U.S. private markets, expressing concerns over the current economic climate and policy unpredictability .\n\n\nThese moves are significant. Pension funds are typically long-term investors, and such shifts indicate a growing unease about the stability of U.S. markets. The potential ripple effects include:\n\nReduced foreign capital inflows into U.S. equities, potentially leading to decreased market liquidity.\n\nIncreased volatility as large institutional investors adjust their portfolios.\n\nPressure on asset valuations, particularly if the trend of divestment continues.\n\n\nThis development underscores the importance of monitoring institutional investment behaviors, as they can serve as early indicators of broader market sentiment shifts.\n\n[Financial Times - Paywalled](https://www.ft.com/content/6eea2278-556a-4395-9f6a-42cf2c6c2363)\n\n---\n\nAddendum 9: Yellen Just Sounded the Alarm - 14th of April\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has now publicly acknowledged what this thread has been screaming for days:\n\n&gt; “The selloff in Treasuries is very worrisome, especially in light of Trump’s tariff policies.”\n—Yellen, via [The Hill](https://thehill.com/business/5247789-yellen-dollar-based-assets-trump-tariff-policies/)\n\n\nThe top financial officer in the United States just admitted the core pillar of American finance—its ability to sell debt—is under threat. Not due to inflation. Not due to organic rate shifts. But due to policy-induced trust collapse.\n\nYellen specifically pointed to:\n\nDollar-based assets losing appeal\n\nTariffs as a destabilizing force\n\nThe need to reassure foreign holders of U.S. debt\n\n\nThis is no longer a fringe take.\nThis is no longer speculative.\nThis is Treasury-confirmed systemic risk.\n\nAnd if she’s going public with it, you can bet the internal data looks even worse.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 10: China Is Building New Export Markets - 14th of April \n\nOn April 14, President Xi Jinping began a high-level tour of Southeast Asia, starting with Vietnam—formally aimed at \"regional cooperation,\" but practically a geoeconomic pivot away from U.S. dependency.\n\n&gt; The visit, [planned for weeks](https://www.reuters.com/world/vietnam-host-china-eu-leaders-coming-weeks-amid-us-tariff-risks-sources-say-2025-04-02/) and part of a wider trip in Southeast Asia, comes as Beijing faces 145% U.S. duties, while [Vietnam is negotiating](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-vietnam-agree-launch-trade-deal-talks-tariffs-paused-2025-04-10/) a reduction of threatened [U.S. tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) of 46% that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.”\n—[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-xi-meet-vietnam-leaders-kick-off-southeast-asia-tour-amid-us-tariffs-2025-04-14/) \n\n\nThis isn’t a courtesy call. It’s a strategic rerouting of export flow. And Vietnam, already a rising player in global manufacturing and trade logistics, is a perfect staging ground.\n\nWhat this signals:\n\nChina is not bluffing. \n\nOther markets are eager to absorb what the U.S. is pushing away.\n\nThe old global order—U.S.-centered, dollar-settled—is being actively re-engineered.\n\nChina doesn’t need to match tariffs with tariffs. It just needs to build alternatives—and that’s exactly what it’s doing.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 11: The Fed’s Independence Is on the Chopping Block - 14th of April \n\nOn April 14, it was confirmed that the White House will begin interviewing candidates for the next Federal Reserve Chair—months ahead of schedule.\n\n&gt; “The White House will start interviewing candidates for the next Fed Chair this fall.”\n—[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bessent-says-white-house-will-start-interviewing-candidates-next-fed-chair-this-2025-04-14/) \n\n\nLet’s not play coy: this isn’t just succession planning. It’s the next phase of institutional capture.\n\nThe Trump administration has made it clear—through both action and pattern—that it intends to fill the Fed with loyalists, not technocrats. Past appointments have been:\n\n-Underqualified\n\n-Short-lived\n\n-Routinely replaced by deeper loyalists when they showed even a shred of autonomy\n\n\nThis isn’t about rates. It’s about control over monetary levers in a time of financial strain.\n\nWhat this signals to the world:\n\n-U.S. monetary policy is no longer independent\n\n-Market signals may be overridden by political needs\n\n-The one institution still holding credibility with global investors is now up for grabs (don't forget that foreign leaders can openly bring DJT through his crypto and golden visa schemes)\n\nExpect international confidence in U.S. debt and the dollar to deteriorate further, not just because of market signals—but because the referee is being replaced by the player.\n\nThis isn’t just about inflation targeting or QT timelines.\nThis is about the collapse of central bank legitimacy in real time.\n\n---\n\nAddendum 12: U.S. Power Projection No Longer Feared - 16th of April \n\nIn a rare and sobering admission, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has confirmed what many outside the Pentagon have only speculated: the U.S. military’s strategic dominance is no longer guaranteed. In an interview, Hegseth stated that China’s hypersonic missile arsenal is capable of sinking all ten U.S. aircraft carriers within twenty minutes of conflict. This directly challenges the very foundation of U.S. power projection, which has, for decades, relied on carrier strike groups to enforce diplomatic and economic influence across the globe.\n\nHegseth went further, admitting that the United States “loses to China in every war game” currently run by the Pentagon. He characterized China’s military buildup not as defensive, but as explicitly designed to destroy the United States in a direct conflict. The failure, he claimed, lies within the U.S. military-industrial bureaucracy itself—too slow, too politicized, and too bloated to compete with China's rapid and strategically coherent expansion.\n\nThis isn't just a military problem. The credibility of U.S. deterrence underwrites the credibility of the U.S. dollar, the safety of U.S. Treasuries, and the assumption of global economic stability. If the world no longer believes the U.S. can protect trade routes, enforce treaties, or credibly deter a peer conflict, then the financial architecture built atop that assumption begins to wobble.\n\nWhat Yellen hinted at in her comments about declining confidence in dollar-based assets, Hegseth has now echoed in military terms: the U.S. is no longer seen as untouchable. The psychological moat that protected American hegemony is drying up in real time.\n\n[Yahoo news](https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-could-sink-entire-us-100124996.html)\n\n---\n\nThis is my final update.

        "content": "**I am NOT OOP, OOP is u/Career-V-Family**\n\n**Originally posted to r/AITAH**\n\n**Previous BoRUs: [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/s/guJGyD5wBu)**\n\n**[New Update]: AITAH for calling my wife selfish for even considering taking a job across the country and trying to uproot our family?**\n\n**NEW UPDATE MARKED WITH** ----\n\n**Thanks to u/soayherder &amp; u/queenlegolas for suggesting this BoRU**\n\n**Mood Spoilers:** &gt;!not good!&lt;\n\n-----\n\n**RECAP**\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/IUYgAXHcMs): **September 15, 2025**\n\nSo my wife was recently offered a job across the country, which requires relocation but also will have frequent travel obligations. My wife feels this would be a huge plus to her career but issue is we have two children and my practice is here.\n\nWhat she will earn is not even half of what I currently make. She is currently not working so I told her if she wants to take the job she would have to help with childcare expenses which would likely include a nanny cause I sometimes work nutty hours depending if I have a mandated hospital shift. She feels this is unfair because she would have to cover her own living expenses and paying for childcare on top of that would leave her with very little.\n\nThis job is not even providing a relocation bonus. She suggested we move but everything we know is here. Our children have their friends here and transferring my medical license is not all that simple. Her final suggestion is she takes the kids, I stay here and cover the cost of childcare and expenses cause she claims child care and CoL *(editor's note: cost of living)* is cheaper. Just not cheap enough for her potential salary to sustain me being a SAHP.\n\nI want to support her but her suggestions seem half baked to me.\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received the majority of NTAs along with few others**\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** NTA. I would understand if you were a stay at home dad, that would be reasonable. I didn’t really get, are you completely against of her going to work, or this one specifically? If this one then you are completely justified, especially considering that there are kids involved. Ripping them away from their friends is rude and unnecessary\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I am not against her working at all, just not in favor of moving to a different state.\n\n**What are the long term prospects staying locally for OOP's wife?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** In what she wants to do not great. She can leverage her engineering degree to work at a civil engineering firm doing consulting but she did that prior and she hated it. Her current offer actually would have her working on infrastructure and work on something with meaning.\n\n+\n\n&gt; She is a female engineer and sick of working in consulting, she wants to do something that matters but it is a big boys club here. Which is a factor as to why she became a SAHM.\n\n**Commenter 2:** NTA. This seems like a really strange situation for a married couple with children to be in. On the face of it, your wife thinking her taking this job is a viable option is crazy. It clearly doesn’t make sense in all of the ways that matter (logistically, financially, emotionally). The fact she suggested she take the kids and you stay is very, very strange. So it makes me wonder what else is going on? Are you happily married? Has she been a SAHM for a while? Maybe she’s worried about not being able to get back into the workforce, and thinks she has to take any opportunity she gets? Have you sat down as a couple to discuss her getting a job and what that will look like for your family, what’s important etc? Are you willing for your career to take the backseat for a while so she can reestablish herself in her career? Etc etc. lack of communication seems to be the issue here, but also maybe deeper rooted problems in your marriage?\n&gt; \n&gt; **Downvoted Commenter:** As as medical Dr he could get a new job easily. He doesn't say this. There is more than one side here.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **OOP:** It actually is not that simple to just go practice in a completely different state. Where we would move to is not part of IMLC *(editor's note: Interstate Medical Licensure Compact)*. Also I cannot just up and leave my patients like that also.\n\n**Commenter 3:** What is it about this specific job that has her willing to leave you on the other side of the country while she and the kids start a new life? Does she know somebody at this job? Or have connections in the area that you know of? Seems fishy to me.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** From what she has told me she was tapped for this position by her old professor and mentor from college.\n\n**OOP on if he has his own practice or works for someone else**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I have my own practice and also work and teach at our state learning hospital. Director - Multiple Sclerosis Center, and Director - Neurology Residency Program.\n\n+\n\n&gt; I specialize in MS. I am sure many would understand but many of them would be disappointed and it would take time for me to find someone that is willing to do this especially at the rates I take. Not many here take Medicaid.\n\n**How old are OOP's children?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** 5 and 8\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/gxi5FuFoXJ): **September 18, 2025 (three days later)**\n\nUpdate to AITAH for calling my wife selfish for even considering taking a job across the country and trying to uproot our family.\n\nBrief update since I got some requests, not much has changed. I spoke with our kids and of course they like it where we are they are kids. The reason my wife wants to take this job is because she feels due to nature of how she got the offer her old professor / mentor and that she is also a female engineer she understands her position.\n\nMy wife is free to do what she pleases she does not need my permission but by no means can she expect us to uproot everything on the drop of a dime. I would never ask that for you.\n\nI did suggest she tries and create her own firm here and find like minded individuals who share a similar experience and create the work environment she wants. She is concerned she won't be able to break through that barrier of entry. I told we could find a means to fund said venture, but logistics of moving does not make sense at this. I would need at minimum a year to get my affairs in order.\n\nWorking on research, working on opening an infusion center near the hospital that would take every insurance. This is a big one for me since many of the infusion centers near us do not take certain insurances since they pay so little. Looking to possibly expand my MS clinic with more providers who are willing do this labor of love for our community. I cannot just drop all of that.\n\nI did tell my wife I have no intention of stopping her, and if she wishes to go that is fine but I would not be sustaining two households. She moves she would be responsible for all costs associated with the move. I will cover our shared expenses and primary residence and that is all. I will cover everything here and she would be responsible for her own expenses. I told her I would probably also lower or get of the credit cards also since I know her she would live off credit if she had to.\n\nI threw out the option if she can request she works from home three out of the four weeks she is not traveling and we can take it slow. See what the housing market is like, see what schools look like, normal stuff you do before moving. She was not in favor of waiting since allegedly they need her answer by October.\n\nI have no desire to divorce but I am a child of divorce and was raised by my dad. Overall his outlook on divorce has always been no point fighting if the person has already checked out. If my wife wants out I will respect that.\n\nMy wife has only been a SAHP for around 5 years. She worked when we had our first born and well into the pregnancy of our second. She took maternity leave when that was done went back to work. Few months after her return she was passed for a project / contract she did the legwork to secure which lead her to quit and stay home with the kids. Our kids have been in daycare, under grandparents care. My mom took two years to help with our first born her parents took off time for our second. Our second has been in \"academic daycare\" as she puts since they were 3. So it is not like she does not get breaks or is always with the children alone.\n\nMy hours can be chaotic but I made her well aware of this when we started to date and progress. When we started to date I was already vested in our community. My gut tells me she is going to take the job, and yes it possibly will lead to divorce and if that is the case given how much traveling she will be doing I suspect I would be granted primary custody. I would not take CS from her have no desire or need for it.\n\nSorry for the stream of consequences, it is slightly disjointed cause this is an frustrating position to be in. I have no desire to be in this position but I have other responsibilities I cannot just drop without proper notice. If it comes to divorce that is the way it played out and you just roll with it. As my parents told me I will tell my kids. Just because they were no longer together does not mean either of them loved me any less.\n\nGranted it was not a cross country thing in our case, my parents lived blocks away from one another. Was a pretty easy transition on my part, I hope we can do the same for our kids if need be. The deal is far worse than I thought but it is a small start up thing with a small team. Who won the project since they took a huge cut on their profits. So pay is actually a lot less than half what I make. More like one third of what I make if that.\n\nSo I can see how she cannot afford to cover any shared expenses, she probably will barely be able to cover her own expenses. We will see, but all signs point to her taking the job and we will jusy adjust but if divorce happens it happens that is life. I do love my wife but she is her own person with free will. \n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** So she wants to move across the country to take a job that wouldn't even sustain her alone?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She barely will be able to sustain herself, allegedly just a temporary thing until they establish themselves as a firm / company first.\n\n**Commenter 2:** If she takes the job just be careful . See a lawyer about protecting assets in case of divorce , cause my guess is she is by herself , across the country , no kids . It’s like the old saying “ when the cats away the mice will play”\n&gt;  \n&gt; **OOP:** If it comes to that I would not fight it, I will give her half of what she is entitled to. Probably would also just buy her out of the house also. Not going to sweat the little things. She clearly does not like it here. She wants more that is fine.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 2:** I was thinking more about your business and retirement . I hope I’m wrong but also was thinking of doing it behind your back not asking for divorce\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** That is a good point. Was not thinking about that.\n\n**OOP responds to a downvoted comment on what his wife gave up when he was in medical school? What has she done to help contribute to the household?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We were friends when I was in Medical school, were not dating. She did not quit her job until our second child was born, and even that was after a year or so. Leaving my obligations on such short notice is not possible and far from professional. For us to move I would at minimum need a year. Our kids have been in daycare since they were three and we had grandparent support for each child. She is not isolated or anything. Yes, I understand she wants a professional career but this job by all metrics is a bad deal.\n\n**Commenter 3:** What are your hours now and what will they be after you expand your clinic? You said your hours were already chaotic so I’m just curious.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Outside of of my mandated hospital shifts, I am home no later than seven. So around 7 to 7. Once tbey go to sleep I may respond to patient messages, review and update notes from 12 to 2 once a week.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes I do work weekends since some my patients are working parents so that is only time they can come in but that is like 8 to 11 am. Only have a handful of weekend patients, that is a once a month thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Edit: I know it is less than ideal but I have my reasons for going this far, my grandfather had MS and it was rough for him.\n\n**Commenter 4:** I would reconsider child support when the time comes. Your children are young, if you take the child support and do something towards their future, investments or such, it could dramatically change their lives. Regardless of how much you earn, save, etc., with young children it seems like there will be many challenges that we didn't have to face and a bit extra may make an enormous difference in their lives and future.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** May be ego or pride but if we divorce over this I will not request CS and let her use that money how she sees fit. Hopefully she would do what is best for our kids. I don't want to take money from her if we separate when she claimed she could not afford it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would want to limit my interactions with her as much as I can, if she does not pay I don't want to have to chase her, request hearings if she does not pay, or deal with her possible adjustments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thankfully, I have been savings for our kids from day one. I will consult my attorney if it does come to it though.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n#----NEW UPDATE----\n\n[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/ZYKbgFuHg9): **September 29, 2025 (11 days later)**\n\nThis will be my last update, and it was a hard one to make. I appreciate the feedback and suggestions especially the one mentioning the looking at adjacent states. While some will say my priorities are skewed, our children don't want to move and I have close ties to the community. I do feel I have a responsibility to my patients and students. I know for some such commitments seem fleeting but for those with MS it takes a long time to find a doctor they are comfortable with, and that is important especially with such an unpredictable condition. I run local support groups, hold information seminars, take part in trials for new treatments. Currently about to start our own stemcell therapy trial for those with more active and progressive progression that has been resistant to other therapies. Main goal is to get information, but also provide individuals a means to get access to this treatment that already shows promise but it is expensive.\n\nAll of that would be moot if our kids did not want to say, and I get it for some kids don't have a say but they are an active part of our family and their opinion does matter.\n\nNow for the claims I am uncaring, I do care and love my wife but I also feel a relationship is not something you fight for. Either it works or it does not, fighting to prove how deep you care or love someone is weird. Who am I to try and sway or change someone's mind. She wants to go that is her prerogative. So long story short she did take the job.\n\nAs for divorce, she does not want divorce but I am on the fence. Spoke with my parents and in laws and they do agree what she is doing makes zero sense but my wife can be stubborn so as my FIL put it, once she made up her mind nothing will change it. Your only options are go with it and be a safety net for if she fails, and he does agree statistically she will fail.\n\nI don't want to be some fallback plan for if stuff goes south. Her plan for the kids is for them to stay with me and she comes over for major holiday's and two weeks in the summer. Based off expenses she will need some additional support rent will be around $1750 not counting utilities and stuff. Her projected take home will be around $3.5k.\n\nSo more she talks to about this plan worse it seems. So to help I offered to cover six months rent, but most likely this will lead to our separation at the very least. She is slightly upset that I am willing to hire a nanny now that she is leaving, but I explained hiring a nanny when she was not working and our kids have been in \"academic\" daycare as she likes to put. Why exactly would we need a nanny? I reminder her she willfully left her job and I did support that choice cause that is what she wanted to do.\n\nEither way still have not broken the news to the kids, they do know she was thinking of taking a job and may be far away for a time.\n\nI spoke with an attorney and I am going to hold off on it cause everything the kids know is here and they have a established route and support system. So they highly doubt she will try to take them, so overall going to try this LDR thing but idk. A part of me does feel like she is just using me cause I highly doubt she would make this move if she did not have some level of support, even her father said as much.\n\nEnd of the day maybe she wants me to fight for our marriage but way I see it is a marriage worth keeping if you need to fight for it. I love her and do not want her to go but if she feels she must then she must. I am not going to sit here and pretend her happiness is dependent on me or our kids. She is a beautiful person and would be egotistical of me to think she will not find another person who is more in step with her desires.\n\nI think we will be fine no matter what happens, I am prepared to buy her out of the house at market value, will split what needs to be split and call it a day. We will co-parent the best we call. I do not hate her or anything. She currently does not like her current life and that is fine. Maybe I am just a weird guy but I don't see any point in therapy because the fact she wants to do this means this means that much to her and facts are facts if she was thinking of the kids or our marriage she would not even consider this as a viable option, let alone take the offer.\n\nIf divorce ends up happening spoke with my lawyer and he told me it would be up to me to request it, it is not automatically awarded during the custody portion. I most likely will not request it and hope she does what is best for our children when it comes to saving for higher education or future expenses like a house or w/e.\n\nThanks again the feedback, our family will be fine.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Move for her, because he loves her and wants to see her career succeed? Do you know how easy it is for a male doctor who's halfway decent to get a job offer? and how hard it is for a female engineer who's had 5 empty years on her resume to get a job offer in the middle of a recession?\n\nWhen the world is fair and women don't have to speak twice as loud or work treble as hard to be given a fraction of the same recognition, then you can judge her for wanting to take the job.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Our kids don't want to move though. Would you be cool if your parents took from what you knew friends and family to be away from all of that?\n\n**Commenter 2:** I don’t think we’ve ever seen a more rational and level headed person. Maybe that’s the physician in him? Wish you well Doc! She’s having a midlife crisis and you shouldn’t cater to it. Good luck mate\n\n&gt; **Commenter 3:** Eh, a fully rational person wouldn't pay his wife to abandon him and his kids against his will.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **OOP:** I am doing so cause I want to provide best possible route for our kids to have a relationship with their mother. I am not a monster, she is the mother of my children. I don't want her to be struggling to the point that even if she wants to see our children she cannot.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; We are probably done, but I don't want to force that on our kids. If they want nothing to do her that will he for them to choose, but I will limit any excuse she could use that I was the reason things turned out this way.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I will just treat it like any other bill. Don't get me wrong I am fully prepared to divorce, and if she wants to turn this into some spectacle I am also down to go down that rabbit hole, and trust me my attorney is more than willing to take my money to do so. LOL\n\n**Would OOP be on the hook for all of the debt that his wife will accumulate if the divorce happens?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** My lawyer explained while married debt is shared an argument can be made that debt she accumulated in a different state can be taken out of the calculations but I will keep track on that. Part of the reason why my lawyer told me to leave her on my credit so I can motor what is spent and when it gets to a certain threshold I can pull the trigger on the papers.\n\n**Commenter 4:** Understand your reasoning.... but please stick to your 6-month plan. I fear you are being used. Kudos for including your kids in the conversation... that's huge. Shows you are a caring dad.\n\nHonestly, it seems wife wants to bolt... but wants you to be the bad guy on this. DON'T.  If after the 6-months her financial situation has not improved... then force her to make the decision. \n\nHope your patients realize the sacrifice you making for them as well. \n\nStill NTA and best of luck.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yeah, I don't want to give her ammo that she could use to poison the well in the future. If she does not see the kids i want them to see that is on her and nothing to do with me. Sure she may lie, but that is whay receipts are for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Six months is probably all she is getting out of me when it comes to this.\n\n**OOP responds to a comment on if he will have enough money to support his kids' college funds while giving his wife the six-month budget**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We are fortunate. Unless for college goes into the millions they will be fine. Though, I am also not telling them they have a college fund. I want them to work for their future, if need be I will pay for school that is the plus side of being a doctor. Very geriatric field I will always have generally high income.\n&gt; \n&gt; Either way my hope is they push for scholarships and pave their own way but yes I will be a support for them if need be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",
