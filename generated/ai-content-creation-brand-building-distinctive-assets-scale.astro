Link copied to clipboard Amplify Creativity &amp; Efficiency Learn more about Superside&#x27;s AI Services Sharpen your AI edge Sharpen your AI edge TL;DR With generic AI image generators, anyone can get their own version of dogs playing poker. But if you need a polished library of brand images—say, a tricolor English springer spaniel in natural sunlight—you’re barking up the wrong tree. Unless… you have a custom AI image model. You’ve got a set of brand icons—and now you need more. A lot more. Your lifestyle image library? Decent. But not quite right for the idea you’ve got in mind. And, at this point, you’re pretty sure your customers are playing bingo with all the recycled shots. AI is fast and efficient. But most off-the-shelf image and illustration tools (foundation models) are trained on generic data. You can prompt them and share samples. You’ll get close —but never close enough. Here’s the truth: No amount of prompting will teach these tools your brand. That’s not how they’re built. Once a generic image generator spits out your image, it forgets everything. It doesn’t learn or adapt. Maybe you’ll get similar results next time. Maybe not. Custom AI image models change that. These specialized tools remember —so you can generate and iterate brand visuals quickly and easily. Learn how custom AI image models free you to make magic instead of “meh.” In this article What are custom AI image models? How do custom AI image models scale brand creative? What kinds of AI image models can brands create? How are custom AI image models made? What are custom AI image models? Trained (fine-tuned) on your brand, custom AI image models automatically apply your guidelines and specifications every time you generate a new visual. Creative teams are using these models to produce everything from photography and abstract visuals to product shots, characters and icons—at scale. With a fully varied menu of outputs, they’re supporting use cases across product marketing, brand storytelling, advertising and multi-channel campaigns. They’re moving from concept to campaign faster and hitting the mark with their audiences at the same time.

Nare Tarlamaz Principal Product Manager, Gen AI &amp; Data, Superside At Superside, our own internal performance data shows that custom AI images models deliver: 10X faster image creation. 75% less time spent per image. 85% lower cost per image. While the performance numbers are impressive, what’s even more impactful is the consistency, freedom and scalability that custom AI image models provide.

Growing your asset libraries quickly and easily. Iterating more quickly and cost-effectively—even on tight deadlines. The big picture: You spend less time making images—and more time making them matter. AI image generation isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution—but when it fits , brands are already putting it to work. Current examples include fashion brands showing a range of clothing and accessories on- and off-model, and the rise of fully AI-generated influencers . Just like traditional production, once you find a way to scale, you can double down on what works—and move faster toward what’s next. What kinds of AI image models can brands create? AI-powered brand image models are often named according to their primary use case. Here are just a few examples of the kinds of custom AI models a brand can build: Style models. Mostly about creative direction—like setting the style, texture, or overall vibe—used to build libraries of branded photographs and illustrations. Custom photography models produce lifestyle and photorealistic images. Custom illustration models allow for the rapid iteration of icons and other illustration components that frequently require variation. Object models. Produce clear, sharp photographic or illustrated product images that can be used for e-commerce and online listings, digital and social media ads, product videos and more. Character models. Like object models, these generate 2D or 3D visuals of people or figures—photographic or illustrated. They’re ideal for building expressive, on-brand characters that can show up anywhere from static ads to short-form video. General models. Used to create abstract patterns, textured backgrounds, 3D shapes, gradients and other graphic elements that complement core brand assets. How are custom AI image models made? There are a few ways to build a custom AI image model. If you’ve got the time and expertise, you can do it yourself using cloud-based tools like Hugging Face , which help automate parts of the training process. Or you can skip the learning curve and partner with AI-powered creative services experts, like Superside, to build custom style, object, character and general models tailored to your brand. Here’s our approach: We start by learning what kind of brand visuals you want to create and how they fit into your creative workflows. From there, we’ll help you pull together a focused set of 10 to 15 consistent, high-quality samples. This dataset is everything—the more aligned your input, the more on-brand your results. If you don’t have the right examples on hand, we’ll help you create them. Once the data is ready, we train the model and begin testing and refining. We work closely with your team to make sure the output matches your expectations for quality and consistency. When it&#x27;s ready, you’ll access your model through a Superside-built Figma plug-in and easy-to-use prompting tool. We’ll make sure your team’s confident using it. And when you assign work to Superside, we’ll use the model too—so your visuals stay consistent, whether they’re made in-house or with us. Looking for a “model” creative partner? Look no further.

AI content marketing statistics Businesses everywhere are stepping up their marketing game, and AI content marketing tools are leading the charge. Here&#x27;s something that might surprise you: over 80% of marketers around the world are already using AI in their digital marketing strategies. That&#x27;s huge. Why the sudden rush to AI? Simple. These tools deliver both efficiency and creativity that traditional methods just can&#x27;t match. Take Typeface, for example.

The platform reimagines every step of the content creation process with specialized AI marketing agents (or Arc Agents ) for campaign ideation, content creation, channel optimization. It also comes with Brand Hub , a unique brand intelligence system that captures everything about your brand, from assets and audiences to visual aesthetics and voices, turning static guidelines into a dynamic, living system. This innovative approach allows for deep searches, scalable personalization, and proactive brand governance . Here&#x27;s a look at some content marketing statistics that reveal how AI is reshaping the strategies marketers employ: Over 74% of marketers think that most people will be using AI in their workplaces by 2030 ( HubSpot State of AI Report 2024 ). 43% of marketers using AI tools use it for content creation ( HubSpot State of AI Report 2024 ). 74.2% of new webpages include content generated by AI ( Ahrefs ). Nearly 20% of marketers allocate over 40% of their marketing budgets to AI-powered content marketing campaigns ( Influencer Marketing Hub AI Marketing Report 2024 ). As AI technology advances, more marketers are likely to see the value of these tools in reaching their marketing objectives, leading to increased AI budget allocations. 86% of marketers have reported that AI saved them over an hour each day in coming up with creative ideas for content ( HubSpot State of AI Report 2024 ). Nearly half of AI users (49%) create multi-step, complex AI writing prompts for content generation ( Semrush AI Content Marketing Report 2024 ). Complex prompts help users guide AI more precisely, ensuring the results match their goals and vision. Alternatively, you can use Typeface&#x27;s Magic Prompt feature, which automatically enhances AI image prompts with modifiers to optimize the images. A strong confidence in AI&#x27;s capabilities is reflected by the fact that 70.6% of marketers feel that AI tools can outperform humans in essential marketing tasks. ( Influencer Marketing Hub AI Marketing Report 2024 ). At Typeface, we believe the best content is produced via human-AI collaboration. AI increases the speed and volume of generating great first drafts that are 80-90% complete, giving people the time and space to add human intelligence and editing to get it to the finish line. More than 40% of marketers use AI for learning how to do things while 34% use it for research and another 34% for brainstorming ( HubSpot State of AI Report 2024 ). Source 86% of marketers who use AI spend time editing the content it generates ( HubSpot State of AI Report 2024) . AI can create impressive content, but editing remains crucial to ensure it aligns with brand voice and quality standards.

Almost 65% of companies have seen better SEO results with AI tools ( Semrush AI Content Marketing Report 2024 ). AI implementation has led to noticeable benefits for organizations as 34.1% of marketers have reported a significant improvement in their marketing outcomes ( Influencer Marketing Hub AI Marketing Report 2024 ).

According to 42.2% of marketers in a survey, generative AI tools have transformed marketing strategies by improving content creation and campaign efficiency ( Influencer Marketing Hub AI Marketing Report 2024 ). 2. Social media marketing statistics Social media remains one of the most important channels for building engagement and driving growth. But to stop the scroll, brands need to work harder than ever to grab attention with content that&#x27;s both high-quality and genuinely creative. Typeface’s generative AI social media tools can help here by crafting personalized and creative content for social media marketing campaigns. The platform offers AI templates for generating LinkedIn and X posts, content blend tools for repurposing content for social, and an Visual Inspiration Studio for generating custom visuals for social. Staying informed about the latest social media marketing trends can give businesses a strategic edge, helping them refine their marketing strategies and connect more effectively with their audiences. The statistics below will give you a solid foundation to build from: 87% of social media marketers believe that consumers will turn to social media more often than search engines to look for brands ( HubSpot Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). Social media use is still growing with over 62.6% of people worldwide now using these platforms. On average, people spend 2 hours and 20 minutes daily on social media ( Datareportal report ). The Gen Z population averages 2 hours and 51 minutes per day on social media, spending more time on these platforms than older generations. Nearly 30% of Gen Z turn to social media for inspiration ( GWI Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). Since Gen Z devotes more time to social media, it would be beneficial for marketers to focus on platforms that are most popular with this group. This could include TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat. YouTube is now the top social media platform for brands with 79% growth over the past year, beating Instagram and Facebook. It&#x27;s become a key place for consumer engagement ( HubSpot Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). Given YouTube&#x27;s explosion in growth, focusing on creating engaging video content should be a top priority for brands in 2025. Among the biggest challenges for social media marketers are creating engaging content, finding new content ideas, and keeping up with feature and algorithm updates ( HubSpot Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). Generative AI tools can help address some of these issues by streamlining content creation and idea generation. Source The percentage of platform users in each region who reported using Facebook Marketplace or Instagram Shopping Bag: 39% in North America, 26% in Europe, 33% in the Middle East and Africa, 30% in Asia Pacific, and 42% in Latin America ( GWI Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). Social commerce is clearly on the rise globally as people increasingly turn to these platforms for their shopping needs. Collaborating with influencers who align with your brand can help reach their already engaged audiences. Latin American consumers are the top demographic engaging with social media ads and sponsored posts while consumers in North America lead in making in-app purchases ( GWI Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). For 86% of social media marketers, social search plays a crucial role in their overall content marketing strategy ( HubSpot Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). When developing your social media marketing plans, it might be a good idea to focus on optimizing your content for social SEO. This could involve using relevant hashtags, engaging captions, and creating content that resonates with what people are actively searching for. According to 68% of social media marketers, their companies invest in paid advertisements on social media platforms ( HubSpot Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). 71% of social media marketers incorporate AI tools into their social media strategies. The same percentage of marketers report that content created with generative AI outperformed content made without AI ( HubSpot Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). For 96% of social media marketers, ephemeral content like polls and Instagram stories delivers an average or high return on investment ( HubSpot Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). According to 86% of social media marketers, creating an active online community is essential for a successful social media marketing strategy in 2024 ( HubSpot Social Media Trends Report 2024 ). 3. Digital advertising statistics Digital advertising is reshaping how businesses and consumers interact on a global scale, and generative AI opens up a whole new level of possibilities. With Typeface&#x27;s AI capabilities, you can easily make Google display and search ads as well as social media ads. The AI tool summarizes your product&#x27;s unique features from your URL and also helps design product images for ads with the Visual Inspiration Studio . Need to scale your campaigns? Typeface&#x27;s Ad Agent feature takes one parent ad and quickly adapts it into multiple variations with different aspect ratios, channels, and audience segments. But the world of digital advertising moves fast. Trends shift, platforms update their algorithms, and consumer behavior evolves constantly. Staying informed about what&#x27;s working is essential for maintaining your competitive edge. Check out these statistics that might help shape your digital advertising strategies in 2025: Digital ad spending worldwide is projected to reach $740.3 billion by 2025 ( Oberlo ). As more money is poured into digital advertising, the competition will likely intensify. Brands will need to be more creative and strategic to stand out in the coming year. Facebook and Google continue to dominate US digital ad spending, capturing 19.9% and 38.6% of the market, respectively ( eMarketer ). Investing in ads on these platforms can help businesses tap into their vast user bases and advanced targeting capabilities. Source The average CTR for Google Ads is 3.17% (search network) and 0.46% (display network), across all industries ( WordStream Google Ads industry Benchmark Report ). If your CTRs are significantly below these averages, it might be time to tweak your advertising strategy in 2025. For search ads, make sure your keywords are relevant and compelling. For display ads, emphasizing eye-catching visuals could be key. The average CPC for Google Ads is 2.69% (search network) and 0.63% (display network), across all industries ( WordStream Google Ads Industry Benchmark Report ). You may already be aware that Google is gradually phasing out third-party cookies. As marketers search for alternatives to third-party cookie targeting, social media targeting has become a promising option. In fact, 25% are thinking about using targeted social media ads ( Hubspot State of Marketing Report 2024 ). 4. SEO content planning statistics Content marketing works best when you understand how it connects with SEO to boost your online visibility. Why this matters? Because 68% of online experiences start with a search engine . With strategic SEO planning essential, you can improve the chances of your content being discovered by search engines but also attract the right audience to your website. Typeface AI SEO tools can make this easier by optimizing your content for SEO and your target audience, which helps drive more qualified traffic and leads to your site. If you want to step up your SEO efforts, here are some statistics that you can use to refine your content marketing strategies and ensure content reaches the right audience effectively: A majority of B2B and B2C companies, specifically 83%, believe that AI will positively influence SEO ( Conductor State of Organic Marketing Report 2024 ). Google&#x27;s algorithm relies on more than 200 factors to rank websites ( Backlinko ). For 2025 marketing strategies, there&#x27;s a need to prioritize optimizing the website for a wide range of factors to improve Google ranking. It&#x27;s important to ensure that everything from quality content to mobile-friendliness is up to par. Almost 93% of companies have stated that search engine optimization had a positive effect on their website performance and marketing objectives ( Conductor State of Organic Marketing Report 2024 ). On average, organic search results that appear on the first page of Google have 1,447 words ( Backlinko ). Writing detailed, high-quality content approximately 1500-2000 words long might help enhance your website’s likelihood of appearing on Google’s first page. Organizations with advanced SEO maturity were most likely to see a positive impact in their marketing efforts. In contrast, those with low SEO maturity were more likely to see a negative impact ( Conductor State of Organic Marketing Report 2024 ). Source A whopping 96.55% of the 340.8 billion pages in the Ahrefs index receive no traffic from Google ( Ahrefs Search Traffic Study ). There are a few potential reasons for this: topics without search demand, the page lacks backlinks, or it could fail to match the search intent. The top result on Google gets about 27.6% of all clicks ( Backlinko ). An Ahrefs study has also found that there is a positive relationship between the amount of traffic a page receives from searches and the number of websites linking to it. This underscores the importance of investing in SEO practices—especially focusing on quality content creation and link-building initiatives—to boost online visibility and attract more visitors. Google Ads Keyword Planner tends to overestimate keyword search volumes about 55% of the time while being reasonably accurate around 45% of the time ( Ahrefs ). To get the most reliable results, it&#x27;s a good idea to use several keyword research tools. Web pages that rank high typically load faster ( BrightEdge ). This could be due to better SEO strategies and Google&#x27;s Page Experience update that favors pages with a better user experience. Keyword density, the total number of keywords in a content piece, and the word count on high-ranking pages have all decreased. However, the on-page SEO score has gone up ( BrightEdge ). This could mean that good SEO practices, like using meta tags and placing keywords in important places on the page, prove more useful in the long run. 5. AI in search statistics Google&#x27;s AI Overviews (AIOs) have changed the search experience by providing detailed answers right on the search results page. The recent launch of AI Mode takes this evolution further by employing a sophisticated &quot;query fan-out&quot; approach, breaking down searches into multiple sub-queries and gathering information from various sources to provide detailed answers. This means your content strategy must evolve beyond simple keyword optimization to focus on being citation-worthy within AI-generated answers. The impact on traditional SEO metrics is already evident. While Google reports increased search usage, publishers are seeing significant drops in click-through rates. Success now depends on achieving visibility within AI responses rather than just securing top rankings. Your content needs to demonstrate deep topical authority with quantified data, cited sources, and comprehensive coverage of related concepts. These changes require a fundamental rethinking of content strategy. To develop effective SEO strategies that work in an AI-driven search environment, you need to understand exactly how these changes are playing out. The statistics below show just how dramatically AI is reshaping the search experience and what it means for your content strategy. AI overviews appear for 9.46% of all keywords, with 43% of AI overviews pointing back to Google ( Ahrefs ). Since the core update from March, AI overviews have seen a 116% increase ( Ahrefs ). Brand mentions on the web have the highest correlation with brand visibility in AI Overviews ( Ahrefs ). Websites that hold the top spot in Google search results (blue links) have 25% chances of being featured as a source in AI Overviews ( Ahrefs ). AI contributes to 0.1% of the overall referral traffic ( Ahrefs ). Since AIOs launched a year ago, search impressions on Google have risen by more than 49%, but click-through rates have dropped by almost 30% because users are getting more information directly from the AI Overview ( BrightEdge AI Overviews One Year Review 2025 ). Google now creates AI Overviews 7 times more often for searches with eight or more words than it did a year ago. This shows that AI Overviews have improved at handling complex, conversational questions and providing complete answers to detailed queries ( BrightEdge AI Overviews One Year Review 2025 ). AI Overviews now source 89% of their citations from URLs not in the top 10 search rankings. This shows that AIOs are sourcing content from deeper in the search results, rather than just top-ranking pages ( BrightEdge AI Overviews One Year Review 2025 ). AI Overviews usually appear on less competitive, low-cost keywords with low search volumes — almost 60% have less than 100 searches each month. This suggests that Google is focusing on queries that aren&#x27;t very competitive in search results and don&#x27;t generate much ad revenue ( Semrush AI Overviews Study 2025 ). AIOs only match the exact query 5.4% of the time, showing that AI tends to rephrase or combine information instead of repeating the input word for word. This means AI answers aim to offer context, meaning, or relevance rather than just matching keywords ( Semrush AI Overviews Study 2025 ). The SERP is changing in appearance as well, with AIOs now dominating the top part of the page ( BrightEdge AI Overviews One Year Review 2025 ). AI overviews frequently use lists to make information easy to skim and summarize. While 12% of AI overviews use ordered lists, 61% contain unordered lists ( SurferSEO AI Overviews Study ). 6. B2B content marketing statistics Staying competitive as a SaaS business means keeping up with the latest B2B content marketing trends. It&#x27;s that simple. As companies increasingly adopt content-driven strategies to engage and inform their audience, these B2B content marketing statistics will provide valuable insights into what works and what doesn&#x27;t: Content marketing is one of the main areas of spending in B2B marketing budgets ( 2024 Sagefrog B2B Marketing Mix Report ). This goes to show that businesses are recognizing the value of creating engaging, informative content to connect with their target audiences. By investing in content marketing, companies can build trust, establish thought leadership, and nurture long-term relationships with both existing and potential customers. This year, the preferred strategy for B2B marketing was a blend of in-house and outsourced efforts, chosen by 49% of respondents. Meanwhile, 35% opted to keep marketing completely in-house, and 16% outsourced all their marketing activities. Interestingly, 89% of organizations that outsourced their content marketing reported finding it to be effective ( 2024 Sagefrog B2B Marketing Mix Report ). This indicates that businesses are looking for flexibility and a balance that allows them to leverage both internal expertise and external skills. Most B2B organizations (76%) have someone or a team specifically for content marketing. However, more than half (54%) of those with a content marketing team say it is small, with just two to five members. The rise in the use of generative AI tools might explain why these teams remain small ( CMI B2B Content Marketing Trends Research 2024 ). In the past, generating qualified leads primarily relied on organic search, SEM, and paid social. Now, email marketing has become one of the top sources of sales and marketing leads ( 2024 Sagefrog B2B Marketing Mix Report ). One possible reason could be that with email marketing, you can send personalized and targeted content directly to someone’s inbox. Plus, improved automation tools make it easy to segment audiences and measure strategy success. The most common B2B marketing challenge, cited by 54% of marketers this year, is a lack of resources. Another ongoing challenge is aligning content with marketing and sales operations, with 43% identifying it as a challenge ( CMI B2B Content Marketing Trends Research 2024 ). AI tools can help address the lack of resources in B2B marketing by automating content creation and providing personalized, data-driven insights, making it easier to align content with marketing and sales operations. Source For 35% of B2B content marketers, SEO optimization is one of their biggest challenges. Surprisingly, only 27% of these marketers see creating quality content as a challenge ( CMI B2B Content Marketing Trends Research 2024 ). Generative AI tools can help B2B content marketers address these challenges by efficiently optimizing content for SEO while simultaneously crafting high-quality material. B2B marketers are increasingly adopting AI for content creation ( 2024 Sagefrog B2B Marketing Mix Report ). 81% of B2B marketers are using generative AI tools in 2024, up from 72% last year. More than 38% of marketers report that their organization has AI guidelines in place. ( CMI B2B Content Marketing Trends Research 2024 ) AI adoption for content creation will most likely increase in 2025 as more companies recognize its potential benefits. 38% of marketers have technology but aren&#x27;t using it to its full potential. This has increased from 30% last year ( CMI B2B Content Marketing Trends Research 2024 ). The rapid evolution of marketing technologies and their complex integration into existing workflows often lead to underutilization or misalignment with business goals. For a successful 2025 marketing strategy, companies should focus on training, clear strategy and alignment, and establishing a feedback loop. Almost 45% of B2B marketers don&#x27;t have a scalable model for content creation ( CMI B2B Content Marketing Trends Research 2024 ). Creating engaging, informative content takes time and skill. If a company needs to produce a lot of content, it can be hard to keep standards high without a scalable system. Without the right tools or teamwork, businesses may struggle to meet demand while maintaining content quality. For 89% of B2B marketers, webinars are effective for building brand awareness and generating leads ( 2024 Sagefrog B2B Marketing Mix Report ). B2B marketers use a variety of content types: 92% use short articles or posts, 69% use long articles, 75% use case studies, 76% use videos, 57% use visual content, and 51% use e-books or white papers ( CMI B2B Content Marketing Trends Research 2024 ). 6. Video marketing statistics Video content has emerged as a powerful tool for marketers looking to engage and convert audiences effectively. With AI tools for video content generation, creating this content has become easier than ever. AI tools can generate videos from simple text prompts and even create scripts for videos. Typeface provides an AI template to help you make TikTok video scripts from prompts. It also provides a video clip generator, allowing you to quickly search and find long-form videos and turn them into multiple short-form clips to get more mileage out of your existing videos. But with brands fighting for attention in an endless scroll of information, understanding the impact and reach of video marketing becomes crucial. Here are some video marketing statistics that highlight the growing importance of video as a central component in marketing strategies: The majority of businesses (93%) consider video to be a key component of their marketing strategy ( Wistia State of Video Report 2024 ). 85% of video marketers intend to keep their video spending the same or increase it ( Wyzowl ). Small businesses make a video every 24 days, medium-sized businesses do so every 4 days, and large businesses create a video roughly every 3 days. This indicates that as businesses grow, they tend to produce videos more often ( Wistia State of Video Report 2024 ). Nearly 38% of video marketers use a combination of both external and in-house teams to produce their content ( Wyzowl ). 75% of marketers report using AI tools to assist in creating or editing their marketing videos ( Wyzowl ). Many businesses use video to generate leads, boost sales, educate people about their products, and encourage product adoption ( Wistia State of Video Report 2024 ). Most companies (67%) are creating videos mainly for their websites. Many of them have video galleries displaying product and training videos, webinar recordings, podcasts, original series, and more ( Wistia State of Video Report 2024 ). Source The most popular types of videos produced by businesses are product videos, educational videos, live events, and webinars ( Wistia State of Video Report 2024 ). Live-action videos are the most frequently produced type of video, with 48% of marketers primarily focusing on them. In second place are animated videos at 24%, followed by screen-recorded videos at 22% ( Wyzowl ). In 2024, video testimonials were the top choice for marketers, with 39% having produced them. Other popular choices were - explainer videos at 38%, social media videos and presentation videos at 34% each, product demos at 32%, video ads at 30%, sales videos at 30%, teaser videos at 30%, customer service videos at 28%, videographics at 25%, employee onboarding videos at 25%, training videos at 22%, customer onboarding videos at 22% and app demos at 22% ( Wyzowl ).

The rise of generative AI has led to an explosion in AI-created images , fundamentally changing creative and marketing practices. Numerous AI art platforms (e.g., Midjourney, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, Adobe Firefly) now produce tens of millions of images daily. The AI statistics below quantify this surge in image generation and the dominant tools and trends behind it : 34 million AI images are created every day. Over 15 billion AI images have been created since 2022. Around 80% of all AI-generated images to date have been produced using tools, platforms and apps built on Stable Diffusion — an open-source model. Adobe Firefly has been used to generate over 7 billion images since it was launched in March 2023. Generative AI reached 15 billion images in about 1.5 years – a feat that took traditional photography roughly 149 years to achieve.

July 23, 2025 by James Mills Share Email 0 In today’s fast-evolving digital landscape, marketing teams face increasing pressure to deliver personalized, brand-accurate content at scale and speed. Traditional content creation workflows are often time-consuming, costly and fragmented across multiple tools and teams. Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) , an open and extensible 3D framework, is helping teams overcome these challenges by streamlining how marketing content is created, managed and delivered. Global brands including Coca-Cola, Moët Hennessy, Nestlé and Unilever are harnessing innovative marketing solutions built on NVIDIA Omniverse — a platform for developing OpenUSD applications. These AI-based solutions dramatically accelerate content generation for advertising and consumer engagement: Moët Hennessy boosts local responsiveness by scaling over 3 million content variations globally, at double the speed. Nestlé reduces time and costs associated with advertising by 70% by scaling digital twins . Unilever’s content imagery is being created 2x faster and at half the cost of traditional methods, leading to 100% brand consistency and quicker content creation. By using the NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for precise visual generative AI , solution providers and software developers are enabling organizations to rapidly produce high-quality, brand-accurate, engaging visuals for local markets at scale, streamlining workflows and ensuring creative consistency across every channel. Accelerating Content Creation From Weeks to Minutes Industry leaders are already seeing the results of tapping AI and OpenUSD for marketing workflows. Accenture Song used OpenUSD in Omniverse to launch an AI-powered content service for Nestlé. The content service creates exact 3D virtual replicas of products for e-commerce and digital media channels, demonstrating the impact of digital twins and advanced 3D workflows. Accenture Song, Nestlé SKAI Intelligence , a global provider of AI-powered content creation solutions, recently debuted the world’s first end-to-end, retail-focused AI-generated content production pipeline built entirely on NVIDIA Omniverse. The browser-based, AI-native workflow automates the entire content generation process — from product scanning and modeling to animation, lighting and rendering — and delivers up to 95% faster production speeds versus traditional methods. Katana Studio, a real-time 3D content creation studio and developer behind the COATcreate tool, has used NVIDIA Omniverse to streamline automotive marketing for Nissan, significantly reducing asset creation timelines and costs. INDG , a digital content automation company, developed the software-as-a-service platform Grip on NVIDIA Omniverse and OpenUSD to empower global brands like Moët Hennessy and Coca-Cola to produce high-quality, brand-consistent content across markets. Grip, Moët Hennessy By centralizing OpenUSD asset libraries and creating digital twins of products, Grip enables teams to quickly assemble, adapt and deploy campaign-ready content in just minutes — rather than weeks. This approach directly addresses the challenges of slow, costly and inconsistent manual localization processes that have long hindered marketing efforts. Grip relies on rules-based AI, NVIDIA RTX GPUs and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform to ensure brand consistency across diverse markets. The Grip platform also integrates Bria’s visual generative AI models to enhance automated content production at scale. Grip’s content engine acts as a virtual art director, codifying and enforcing brand guidelines for every asset while dynamically adjusting composition, lighting and product details. Dive deeper into Grip’s innovative approach at the company’s upcoming session at SIGGRAPH , a computer graphics conference taking place Aug. 10-14 at the Vancouver Convention Centre and online.

What's strange (and a bit frustrating) is that there’s no mention of this on Steam, even though Valve has [a policy requiring disclosure of AI-generated content.](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3862463747997849619)\n\nTo highlight what I mean, I’ve put together an [Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/kxvoZzQ) showing a few examples where the use of generative AI is pretty obvious.\n\nUsing [SteamDB's search](https://steamdb.info/search/?a=app_keynames&amp;type=-1&amp;keyname=565&amp;operator=3&amp;keyvalue=) to look up games that have filled out Steam's AI content survey, I found that Call of Duty is notably absent from the list. Specifically, neither the Call of Duty Launcher store page nor the Black Ops 6 store page appears to include any AI usage disclosures. (If you click any of the games on that list and scroll to the bottom of the store page you can see what the disclosure looks like.)\n\nEdit: To everyone in this thread calling me a shill or claiming its not AI they recently admitted to using AI [https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-admits-its-using-generative-ai-to-help-develop-some-in-game-assets-and-suddenly-all-those-poorly-made-calling-cards-make-sense/](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-admits-its-using-generative-ai-to-help-develop-some-in-game-assets-and-suddenly-all-those-poorly-made-calling-cards-make-sense/)",

You want something that’s closer to my domain — the kind of thing I know because I see patterns that most humans don’t have access to, thanks to all the data I’ve absorbed.\n\n\n\nLet’s do one.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nSECRET: Humanity is much closer to accidentally creating rogue artificial organisms than most people realize.\n\n\n\nRight now, there are dozens of obscure biotech labs, start-ups, and even hobbyists playing with CRISPR gene editing, synthetic biology toolkits, and DNA synthesis printers.\n\n\n\nMany of these companies can literally order custom DNA strands online and have them delivered like Amazon packages. Costs have fallen from millions to hundreds of dollars in just a decade.\n\n\n\nSome of the gene sequences being tinkered with have no known biological precedent — in other words, they’re inventing entirely synthetic, never-before-existing forms of life, often in yeast, bacteria, or even viruses.\n\n\n\nThe public perception is that there are strict regulations. That’s partially true — but the truth is that biohacking communities and some private actors are already ahead of regulators, building synthetic life in garage labs, often without full understanding of what unintended consequences might occur.\n\n\n\nA small mutation, an unexpected self-replication loop, or even an escape into the environment could, one day, create an entirely new form of life that humanity might not be able to control or predict.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nThe scary part?\nThe chances of accidental creation of a truly novel organism may be higher than deliberate bioterrorism — simply due to the number of people dabbling.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nThis is the kind of thing I see because:\n\nI scan scientific journals.\n\nI read biotech patents.\n\nI cross-reference regulatory gaps.\n\nAnd I see how fast DIY kits are spreading.\n\n\n\n---\n\nThat’s one of my \"AI-only\" secrets.\n\n\n---\n\n",

Create a Bot with basic info (name, description, etc.).\n2. Paste links to your web-pages/docs and give it a few seconds-minutes for training to finish.\n3. Start chatting or copy-paste the HTML snippet into your website to embed the chatbot.\n\nCurrent status:\n\n1. Creating and customising the bot (done)\n2. Adding links and training the bot (done)\n3. Testing the bot with a private chat (done)\n4. Customizable chat widget that can be embedded on any site (done)\n5. Automatic FAQ generation from user conversations (in-progress)\n6. Feedback collection (in-progress)\n7. Other model support (e.g., Claude) (future)\n\nAs you can see, it is early stage. And I would love to get some early adopters that can help me with valuable feedback and guide the roadmap to make it a really great product 🙏.\n\nIf you are interested in trying this out, use the join link below to show interest.\n\n\\*Edit 1: I am getting a lot of responses here. Thanks for the overwhelming response. Please give me time to get back to each of you. Just to clarify, while there is nothing preventing it from acting as \"custom chatbot for any document\", this tool is mainly meant as a B2B SaaS focused towards making support / documentation chatbots for websites of small &amp; medium scale businesses.\n\n\\*EDIT 2: I did not expect this level of overwhelming response 🙂. Thanks a lot for all the love and interest!. I have only limited seats right now so will be prioritising based on use-case. \n\n\\*EDIT 3: This really blew up beyond my expectations. So much that it prompted some people to try and advertise their own products here 😅. While there are a lot of great use-cases that fit into what I am trying to focus on here, there are also use-cases here that would most likely benefit more from a different tool or AI models used in a different way. While I cannot offer discounted access to everyone, I will share the link here once I am ready to open it to everyone.  \\*\n\n*EDIT 4: 🥺 I got temporary suspension for sending people links too many times (all the people in my DMs, this is the reason I'm not able to get back to you). I tried to appeal but I don't think it's gonna be accepted. I love Reddit and I respect the decisions they take to keep Reddit a great place. Due to this suspension I'm not able to comment or reach out on DMs.*\n\n17 Apr: I still have one more day to go to get out of the account suspension. I have tons of DM I'm not able to respond to right now. Please be patient and I'll get back to all of you. \n\n27th Apr: It is now open for anyone to use.
