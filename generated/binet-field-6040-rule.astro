        "content": "Binet and Field’s 60/40 Marketing Rule: What It Is, and What It Means for Your Company Dec 6 Written By Ray Young The tension between long and short term investment has been at the very center of business strategy since the concept of business first emerged. These days, Binet and Field’s extensive findings in the art of marketing seem almost as fundamental—and for good reason. Their well-known 60/40 investment rule-of-thumb has become standard precisely because it adheres to those principles of investment which have held true since time immemorial. Things which are standardized, however, are soon at risk of being overlooked and under-considered. The most profound ideas can become so familiar that they lose their meaning, and thereby their utility. What little public conversation does take place around the 60/40 rule today has become overly concerned with debates about the specific numbers and proportions, losing sight of the principles which underlie them. For that reason, a slightly more in-depth discussion on the topic is very much due—and that is the purpose of this post. What Is the 60/40 Rule? The 60/40 rule, in a sentence, states that 60% of a company’s marketing budget should be invested toward long-term brand building, while 40% of that budget should go toward short-term activation. Those terms require unpacking, naturally. First, brand building refers to creating a lasting presence within the minds of potential consumers. And, second, activation means realizing that potential with an immediate call to action. Each of these support the other, as a well-developed brand increases the likelihood of immediate action, and apt calls to action allow brand potential to be realized. Why, and How, Should They Be Split? How come, if these two aspects of marketing are so closely intertwined, should they be split up at all? Couldn’t a business just market in a way that incorporates both goals in every effort? Yes and no, according to Les Binet himself . Most marketing efforts do indeed progress both sides at least a little. A sponsorship is likely to result in a few short-term sales, even if its primary function is generating brand awareness. Likewise a well-designed point-of-sale, intended for short-term activation, could increase brand perception at the same time. In either case, however, one function overshadows the other. The caveat is that brand and activation efforts differ on two integral fronts: audience and content. This difference is informative not only as to why these facets should be separated, but also how. First, consider brand building. Brand building efforts are, and ought to be, focussed on a general audience which consists of any and everybody who might enter the buying market within the span of a year, give or take, but remain outside the market for the time being. Since that audience is not yet interested in buying, the content of these efforts should be generally interesting, appealing to basic human needs and desires without being overly specific—and it should be memorable. Now consider activation. Consumers who are already in the market for your product constitute this audience; they are an action away from buying, so to speak. As such, content should be detailed, informative, and useful, providing specific reasons why they should purchase your product right now . Is it Really 60/40? The question remains: should a company’s marketing budget really always be divided into precisely 60% for brand and 40% for activation? No, of course not. As with any rule of thumb, 60/40 is merely a tangible handle for a deeper principle, the one discussed above. Actual numbers will vary from industry to industry, and then from company to company. Some situations—like breakout technology—will call for more brand, while others—like commodities—tend to call for more activation. It is the part of the company to work backward from the underlying purposes toward a balance which is appropriate for their circumstance. Bottom Line Binet and Field’s 60/40 rule applies to marketing one of, if not the most important principles in business: short term investment must be kept in proportion to long term investment. To understand the rhyme and reason behind the rule—rather than fixating upon the particulars—is to equip one’s company for the often uncertain and always dynamic nature of the market. With a firm grasp on what both brand and activation actually are, as well as why and how to utilize them, businesses can market with boldness regardless of circumstance.

        "content": "Unveiling the 60/40 Rule: The Ideal Budget Split for Marketing Success Posted on April 24, 2025 August 11, 2025 Author business901 Understanding the 60/40 Rule in Marketing Definition of the 60/40 Rule : The 60/40 Rule in marketing is a strategic budgeting framework that suggests allocating 60% of a marketing budget towards performance marketing initiatives while dedicating 40% to brand-building efforts. This balanced approach recognizes the need for immediate returns through measurable campaigns while nurturing a brand&#8217;s long-term health. In essence, it blends the short-term gains from direct response activities with the long-term benefits of brand awareness and loyalty. Imagine a company launching a new product. If it invests primarily in performance marketing, it might see quick sales spikes but neglect the brand&#8217;s identity. Conversely, focusing solely on brand-building—like ads and storytelling—may fail to drive immediate sales. The 60/40 Rule thus advocates for a holistic strategy catering to immediate and enduring business goals. History and Evolution of the 60/40 Rule : The origin of the 60/40 Rule can be traced back to marketing scholars and practitioners who recognized the dual nature of marketing investments in the late 20th century. As businesses began to navigate a rapidly changing landscape, it became clear that relying heavily on one aspect of marketing could be detrimental. Over the years, the applicability and understanding of the rule have evolved: 1990s : Early iterations focused primarily on advertising versus direct marketing. Early 2000s : With the advent of the digital age, the need for performance marketing surged. Present Day : Marketers now emphasize the role of data analytics and customer engagement to optimize the spending ratio effectively. With its roots in traditional marketing, the 60/40 Rule continues to flex and adapt to contemporary strategies, proving its sustained relevance in the age of data-driven decision-making. As marketing channels proliferate, understanding how to allocate resources effectively becomes crucial for long-term success, making the 60/40 Rule a framework worth considering in any marketing strategy. The 60/40 rule in marketing is generally credited to David Ogilvy, often called the &#8220;Father of Advertising.&#8221; He suggested a good advertisement should contain 60% information and 40% persuasion (or emotional appeal). This balance helps create effective marketing messages that both inform and motivate consumers. The 60/40 rule in marketing, popularized by Les Binet and Peter Field in their seminal work The Long and the Short of It , advocates allocating 60% of marketing budgets to long-term brand building and 40% to short-term sales activation to maximize growth and profitability. Benefits of Implementing the 60/40 Rule Improved Budget Allocation : One of the most significant benefits of implementing the 60/40 Rule in marketing is improving budget allocation. By clearly defining how to split resources, marketers can make more informed decisions about where to invest their time and money. This structured approach helps maximize the impact of marketing dollars and ensures that investments are aligned with overall business goals. For instance, allocating 60% of the budget to performance marketing allows for measurable returns and informs future strategies. Meanwhile, the remaining 40% dedicated to brand-building can create intangible benefits like customer loyalty and recognition over time. Just imagine a budding tech startup focusing heavily on ads to drive downloads while building a strong brand narrative—a powerful combination that can lead to sustainable growth. Key advantages of improved budget allocation include: Better tracking and measurement of both short-term and long-term results. Flexibility to adjust spending based on campaign performance. A clearer understanding of how each dollar contributes to business objectives. Enhanced Marketing Effectiveness: Moreover, the 60/40 Rule significantly enhances marketing effectiveness. By balancing performance marketing and brand-building, businesses can cultivate a robust presence in their market while driving sales. For example, a well-known beverage company might run a social media campaign (performance marketing) simultaneously with a brand awareness initiative highlighting its commitment to sustainability. This dual approach effectively engages customer segments while reinforcing the brand&#8217;s identity. Benefits of enhanced marketing effectiveness include: Increased customer engagement from targeted campaigns. Stronger emotional connections with customers, fostering loyalty. Improved brand image, which can lead to increased market share. Incorporating the 60/40 Rule fosters effective budget allocation and maximizes the overall impact of marketing efforts. By embracing this framework, companies can navigate the complexities of modern marketing with greater confidence and success. Factors to Consider in Applying the 60/40 Rule Market Segmentation and Target Audience : Understanding your market segmentation and target audience is critical when applying the 60/40 rule. The success of this strategy relies heavily on knowing who your customers are and what they want. Without this knowledge, budget allocation may miss the mark, resulting in wasted resources and missed opportunities. For instance, a fashion retailer may target different demographics—teenagers interested in fast fashion and adults seeking sustainable options. By analyzing their preferences, the retailer can allocate 60% of the budget to performance marketing tactics like flash sales for teens while using the remaining 40% for brand-building initiatives focused on sustainability through storytelling and influencer collaborations. Important considerations include: Demographic Factors : Age, gender, income, and location. Psychographic Factors : Interests, values, and lifestyle choices Behavioral Factors : Purchasing habits, brand loyalty, and engagement levels. Understanding these facets empowers marketers to tailor their campaigns effectively, ensuring that performance and brand-building aspects resonate with their target audience. Evaluation of Marketing Channels : Equally important is evaluating the marketing channels employed within the 60/40 framework. Each channel offers unique advantages, and the right mix can significantly impact overall performance. Consider a SaaS company that utilizes social media, email marketing, and paid ads. They need to assess which channels drive the most engagement and conversions. If social media generates significant leads while email marketing nurtures customer relationships, they may decide to allocate their budget accordingly. Factors to weigh when evaluating marketing channels include: ROI : Analyze which channels yield the best returns. Engagement Metrics : Monitor likes, shares, comments, and click-through rates Customer Preferences : Gauge which platforms their audience uses most frequently. By thoughtfully considering market segmentation and evaluating marketing channels, businesses can implement the 60/40 Rule effectively, driving immediate results and long-term brand success. This mindful approach creates a solid foundation for impactful marketing strategies that resonate with the intended audience. Challenges and Limitations of the 60/40 Rule Adapting to Changing Market Dynamics : While the 60/40 Rule offers a balanced marketing approach, it has challenges. One of the most significant hurdles is adapting to the ever-evolving market dynamics. Trends shift, consumer behaviors change, and new technologies emerge, rendering previously effective strategies less applicable. For example, consider a company that allocates a fixed 60% of its budget to performance marketing based on past successes. However, if a sudden shift in consumer preference favors more sustainable brands, that allocation might become less effective. Companies must remain agile, ready to reassess and reallocate their budgets as market conditions dictate. Challenges in adapting to market dynamics include: Emerging Competitors : New players might disrupt established market conditions. Technological Advancements : New channels and tools can change how consumers interact with brands. Consumer Behavior : Changes in lifestyle or values can shift purchasing patterns. Flexibility and willingness to pivot can mean staying relevant and falling behind in a competitive landscape. Measuring the Impact of the Budget Split Another challenge with the 60/40 Rule is accurately measuring the impact of the budget split. While performance marketing provides immediate data on return on investment (ROI), gauging the long-term benefits of brand-building efforts can be more elusive. For instance, a company may invest in branding campaigns, but sales and customer loyalty results may take time to materialize, complicating the evaluation process. Considerations for measuring impact include: Attribution Models : Determining which marketing efforts lead to conversions can be complex. Long-term Metrics : Brand loyalty and awareness are not always quantifiable in the short term. Data Integration : Combining data from various channels can be challenging, making it hard to see the complete picture. In summary, while the 60/40 Rule presents a strategic framework for marketing budgets, organizations must navigate the complexities of market dynamics and measurement challenges to realize their full potential. Adapting strategies to the current landscape while effectively evaluating their impact can enhance the overall effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Future Trends and Innovations in Budget Splitting Strategies Integration of AI and Machine Learning : As the marketing landscape evolves, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into budget-splitting strategies is one of the most promising trends. These technologies can potentially revolutionize how brands allocate resources between performance marketing and brand-building initiatives, making quicker, smarter, and more data-driven decisions. For example, imagine a retail business using AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior across various marketing channels. By identifying which campaigns yield the highest return on investment in real-time, the company can dynamically shift its budget allocation to optimize short-term and long-term results. Key benefits of integrating AI include: Real-Time Analytics : Access to instant insights allows for rapid budget adjustments. Predictive Modeling : AI can forecast trends and consumer behaviors, informing smarter budget splits. Enhanced Targeting : Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast data to pinpoint where dollars are best spent. This foresight enables companies to stay agile and ahead of competitor strategies. Personalization and Customization in Marketing Budgets Another trend shaping the future of marketing budgets is the move toward personalization and customization. Consumers today are inundated with generic advertising and promotions, which is why personalized marketing strategies can significantly enhance engagement and loyalty. For instance, a travel agency can develop distinct marketing budgets for different customer segments—families, solo travelers, and luxury seekers—allocating resources based on individual preferences and behaviors. This approach allows the agency to tailor campaigns to be closely aligned with the interests of each group, leading to higher conversion rates. Important facets of personalization in budget allocation include: Customer Segmentation : Identifying and understanding customer profiles to create targeted campaigns. Dynamic Budgeting : Adjusting budget allocations based on real-time performance data for various customer segments. Tailored Messaging : Crafting custom messages that resonate with individual interests, enhancing brand loyalty. By embracing these innovative approaches to budget splitting, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies and deepen their relationships with consumers. The future holds exciting possibilities, and marketers who harness the power of AI and personalization will likely be in charge of creating impactful and profitable campaigns. Conclusion Recap of the Benefits of the 60/40 Rule : The 60/40 Rule has proven to be a powerful framework for balancing marketing efforts between performance marketing and brand-building initiatives. By allocating 60% of the budget toward performance-driven campaigns, businesses can capitalize on immediate results while investing 40% in sustainable brand-building efforts. This holistic approach enhances short-term profitability and fosters long-term customer loyalty and brand recognition. Companies that successfully implement this rule often find themselves better equipped to navigate the complexities of modern marketing, enabling them to adapt to changing consumer preferences and emerging market trends. Final Thoughts on Its Relevance in Modern Marketing Strategies : The relevance of the 60/40 Rule in today&#8217;s fast-paced marketing environment cannot be overstated. As digital channels multiply and consumer behaviors become less predictable, having a structured approach like this provides much-needed clarity and direction. In a world where personalization, AI, and real-time analytics are becoming the norm, the 60/40 Rule allows marketers to be agile, data-driven and focused on their long-term vision. Ultimately, embracing the 60/40 Rule equips businesses with the tools they need to thrive. By balancing immediate results with enduring relationships, marketers can create a sustainable path toward success and growth in an increasingly competitive landscape.

        "content": "Ehrenberg-Bass News 23rd of August 2022 Published by Mi3 See original article Prof. Byron Sharp skewers Binet &#038; Field’s 60:40 rule, smashes attention metrics, BVOD ad stacking, multi-channel amplification effect; tells marketers to sack agencies preaching share of voice quotas and bet the farm on always-on reach; Ritson backhanded Professor Byron Sharp delivered a broadside last week at the Mi3-LinkedIn B2B Next Summit in a bid to bring marketers back to the fundamentals of advertising, brand building and growth. Marketers adhering to Les Binet and Peter Field’s formula around brand to performance budget ratios are basing investment decisions on questionable data, according to the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute marketing science supremo. He also said advertisers piling into attention metrics risk being “suckered” and implied that multiple iterations of ads – dynamic creative or otherwise – can weaken memory structures and hinder growth prospects. Going for a full house takedown, Sharp suggested proponents of cross-channel network effects are peddling a “myth” before lauding Professor Mark Ritson… for admitting he was wrong about the nuances of “sophisticated targeting”. What you need to know: Professor Byron Sharp told marketers to concentrate on the basics – building mental and physical availability and advertising consistently throughout the year – to drive growth. Addressing the divide between brand and performance camps, or “activation and advertising”, Sharp said brands need both, but that without building memory structures through advertising, no amount of performance advertising would deliver growth. Sharp dismissed the 60:40 brand to performance ratios formulated by Les Binet and Peter Field as based on unsound awards data. He argued paying more for more than fleeting attention is a waste of money. Sharp also suggested that multiple iterations of creative could actually hinder growth and stated the network effects of advertising across channels are “a bit of a myth”. Meanwhile, he said brands paying for BVOD ads running back to back within the same show should get them “for free”. Full mental jacket Sharp told the Mi3-LinkedIn B2B Next conference to focus squarely on mental and physical availability. Marketers should spend their budgets trying to reach all potential buyers in order to grow their category and therefore their brands – the core tenets of his best known book, How Brands Grow. Sharp acknowledged that marketing science moves slowly – but that rigour cannot be shortcut. “We make discoveries and then we spend ten plus years working on those discoveries. What are the implications? How do you say this? How do you communicate this? How do you implement this in an organisation? The ‘D’ in R&amp;D takes a lot longer… and it&#8217;s sort of embarrassing, but it has taken us about 20 years to boil down a lot of very important media discoveries into, I think, two quite simple rules.” In short, reach everybody and be always on with advertising in order to grow. He dismissed “things like attention is the new metric” as “nonsense”, and stated that Binet and Field’s 60:40 brand spend to performance rule is based on flawed data. “Les Binet is a lovely guy, and I would say a good friend of mine, but [the 60:40 rule] really is terrible, very misleading,” said Sharp. “60:40 is supposed to be the magic formula for you. Spend 60 per cent of your money on advertising, whatever that is, no one&#8217;s really clear, and 40 per cent on activations. But people have no idea what activations really are and there&#8217;s no guidelines. So really, you can spend whatever you like. But it sounds good to have a formula,” said Sharp. “If you actually read Peter Field and Les Binet’s first report on this, they analysed a very weird data set, which is award submissions. If you wanted to solve this issue, you would never use that data. But why did they use it? Because that&#8217;s the only data they had &#8230; It&#8217;s not a scientific law, but I think a law that holds is that where there is demand, there will always be supply,&#8221; said Sharp. &#8220;And there was demand. People wanted a number.” He argued marketers must be always on with advertising that builds mental availability over years, aligned with physical availability, so that brands can “catch buyers when they fall”, i.e. when they come into market and are ready to buy. In other words, build brands in the long term to be there at the moment of choice – and have the goods ready to go. “Growth and maintenance largely depends on mental and physical availability,” said Sharp. Physical availability means making your brand “easy to buy … If someone wants to buy from the category you are not too hard to access, your package is not too big for them to get it in the car, you will deliver when they need it – so being able to get it.” Mental availability is about buyers “being able to notice you or even consider you … see you on the shelf, recall you”, he added. Brand and performance Mental and physical availability must overlap to drive growth: “If people are going into the store or onto the screen but they don&#8217;t see you, then your return on physical availability is miserable. But if people know you but you&#8217;re too difficult to buy, then your return on your mental availability is terrible.” Activation – or performance marketing – is a part of physical availability, but if people are not primed to buy and are not in market, “it won’t work” no matter the budget spent, said Sharp. “Physical ability is about catching people when they fall. So if you&#8217;re a 10 per cent share brand, of all the people who are buying from category today you&#8217;d like to get 10 per cent, or maybe a bit more … that&#8217;s what growth is,” said Sharp. “When people buy a car or financial services they typically look at two brands. So the odds are you will get half of them where your brand is in that two – but most of the time it isn’t. So activation is about getting your 50 per cent share, but it’s the advertising, the other stuff, that determines whether you are in that [consideration set of] two. And that probably happened five, 10, 15 years ago,” he added. “Paid search, in store display, price promotions, special offers – all of these things are to catch people when they fall. But people who aren’t in market do not see them – and most people are not in market,” said Sharp. He nodded to fellow Ehrenberg-Bass professor John Dawes’ work on the 95:5 rule , which states that only five per cent of B2B buyers are ever in market, so marketers should focus on the 95 per cent that represent future customers, and sales (and therefore performance budgets) focusing on the five per cent of active buyers.

The majority of marketing budgets are being invested into performance, yet the research suggests that most marketers would prefer not to class their organisation as being led by performance. Indeed, just 19% of marketers surveyed describe their organisation as &ldquo;performance-led&rdquo;. The preferred way for marketers to describe their business&rsquo;s overall marketing approach is &ldquo;balance/hybrid&rdquo;, with 42% of respondents classing their organisation as such. &ldquo;CX-led&rdquo; is the second-most popular, with over a quarter (28%) of marketers stating this is their business&rsquo;s marketing approach. Interestingly, very few respondents say that their business&rsquo;s marketing approach is &ldquo;brand-led&rdquo;, with just 15% describing their organisation as such. Over half of marketers say campaigns &lsquo;too focused&rsquo; on performance The research suggests that around four in five marketers intend to balance their strategic planning between long-term brand equity and short-term performance, however, this is clearly not panning out in budgeting, with almost three-fifths of spend going towards sales activation. This disconnect could be down to planning cycles, suggests the report from Adobe and MMA Global. Its research suggests that 50% of marketers conduct budget reviews based on performance data quarterly, while over one in four (26%) conduct them monthly. Meanwhile, 6% conduct these reviews weekly and 4% do it &ldquo;in real time&rdquo;. The remaining 14% conduct reviews annually. &ldquo;These behaviours risk causing overcorrections based on limited information given the measurement and attribution challenges,&rdquo; the report authors write. The other factor identified by the report authors as driving a culture of short-termism is what influences budgetary decisions. Over a third (36%) of marketers identify C-suite priorities/business goals as &ldquo;the most important&rdquo; factor impacting budget allocation. The priorities of business leadership trumps customer trends and behaviours (27%), market conditions and competitive activity (23%) and innovation and martech advancements (15%) as the most important factor in influencing budget decisions. According to the authors of the report, this focus on what the C-suite wants could mean that objectives of success are more focused on quarterly results and KPIs as opposed to long-term thinking. Indeed, among companies that self-describe their marketing approach as performance-led, marketers are more likely (43%) to say C-suite priorities are the most important consideration over budget versus the general sample (35%).

        "content": "Stop chasing the latest marketing hack. The fundamentals that actually drive growth haven't changed in decades.\n\nWhile everyone's obsessing over new platforms and trending tactics, the smartest marketers are quietly applying timeless principles that work regardless of what's hot this quarter. \n\nThese 14 heuristics cut through the noise to reveal what actually moves the needle—backed by research, not wishful thinking.\n\n# 1. The GDP Truth\n\n*What happened last quarter is most likely what will happen next quarter.*\n\nEconomies—and markets—don’t typically pivot on a dime. Studies on economic inertia and market momentum show that performance patterns often repeat over the short term due to structural factors like existing budgets, contracts, and supply chains. McKinsey has pointed out that market leaders who drive short-term stability tend to maintain momentum, often carrying over performance trends quarter to quarter. If you're making bold moves, use this knowledge to time shifts strategically, knowing that a steady past often equals a steady future.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Analyze recent performance data to identify consistent growth patterns and recurring challenges.\n* Allocate budget based on historical performance for the next quarter, only shifting funds if clear disruptions are expected (like seasonality or major events).\n* Plan adjustments in smaller increments, avoiding major swings. Consider pilot testing new initiatives before committing full resources.\n\n# 2. The Mimetic Rule of the Queue\n\n*People get in lines that are long and buy what they see others buying.*\n\nThis aligns with philosopher René Girard’s theory of mimetic desire: people shape their desires based on observing what others value. When customers see others buying or lining up, it creates a sense of value by association. This is why long lines create a “bandwagon” effect—if others are buying, it must be good. A similar phenomenon was observed in Nielsen’s Global Trust in Advertising report, which found that 92% of consumers trust recommendations from friends, reinforcing that social proof (or mimetic desire) matters.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Create visible demand cues by showing live purchase counts, customer testimonials, or social media reposts of real customers using your product.\n* Utilize influencers or brand advocates to create authentic demand, leveraging “if they’re buying, it must be good” psychology.\n* Highlight user-generated content on your website and social feeds to amplify social proof naturally and encourage more to join.\n\n# 3. The Law of Negative Binomial Distribution\n\n*Most buyers buy little, a few buy a lot, and many buy nothing at all.*\n\nResearch from the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute highlights that purchasing patterns across many categories follow a negative binomial distribution. This means most of your revenue comes from light or occasional buyers, while heavy buyers are much fewer in number. The implication is clear: true growth lies in reaching infrequent or potential customers rather than just focusing on a core group of heavy buyers. This insight can fundamentally change how brands allocate resources to engage new or irregular customers to drive consistent growth.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Target light and occasional buyers through segmented campaigns that gently reintroduce the brand with fresh offers.\n* Optimize messaging for “just browsing” audiences, focusing on content that keeps them engaged and informed rather than pressuring them to buy.\n* Experiment with low-barrier offers (e.g., discounts, samples, entry-level products) designed to convert non-buyers and build familiarity without significant commitment.\n\n# 4. NPS Only Means NPS\n\n*A high NPS score is just that—a high NPS score, not a guarantee of loyalty.*\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS) measures sentiment, but studies by Harvard Business Review found little correlation between high NPS scores and customer retention. NPS is useful for a snapshot of brand perception but doesn’t replace loyalty or predict churn. High-scoring customers can and do leave if a competitor provides a better option.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Monitor high-NPS customers’ behavior over time to track whether their purchase frequency aligns with sentiment.\n* Use follow-up surveys and pulse checks on high-NPS groups, asking about product improvements or what would make them even more likely to stay.\n* Incorporate behavioral data (purchase frequency, social media interactions) alongside NPS to build a fuller picture of loyalty.\n\n# 5. Marketing Works on Two Timescales\n\n*Short-term (demand/direct) and long-term (brand/supply)—you need both.*\n\nResearch from Binet and Field shows that a combination of direct response (short-term) and brand-building (long-term) strategies creates stronger growth. They found that long-term brand campaigns build memory structures that make consumers more likely to buy, while short-term tactics satisfy immediate demands. The balance depends on your company’s growth phase: newer brands may lean heavier on direct response, but mature brands thrive by leaning on both.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Set specific budgets for short-term and long-term goals, avoiding the temptation to dip into brand-building budgets to meet immediate needs.\n* Align campaigns to balance both scales: run awareness campaigns for long-term growth and direct-response ads for immediate impact.\n* Regularly review your budget allocation based on maturity and market phase. For example, if you’re newer, a 60/40 split favoring direct response may work, whereas mature brands could benefit from a 40/60 mix.\n\n# 6. You Need to Acquire New Customers to Grow\n\n*Yes, you need repeat buyers, but new customers are the lifeblood of growth.*\n\nStudies like those from the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute show that growth comes from expanding the customer base, not relying solely on loyalty. Acquisition is essential, but remember that repeated exposure—building familiarity over time—has a profound impact on buying decisions.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Develop acquisition-focused campaigns (e.g., first-time purchase discounts, referral programs) that specifically target new customers.\n* Use broader targeting criteria on paid platforms to reach a wider audience and test different creative approaches to engage new people.\n* Track retention metrics on newly acquired customers to refine acquisition strategies, focusing on which channels and messages bring back repeat customers.\n\n# 7. ROI is a Limiting Metric\n\n*Originally for manufacturing, ROI limits rather than captures true marketing impact.*\n\nMarketing ROI focuses on immediate financial return but misses third-order effects like brand awareness and customer loyalty. The IPA Databank found that ROI-driven campaigns often prioritize short-term results, neglecting brand value and diminishing long-term growth. Adopting broader metrics helps align marketing’s strategic importance beyond the limitations of spend alone.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Use multi-metric reporting that includes metrics like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), brand awareness, and engagement alongside ROI.\n* Run brand lift studies to assess broader campaign effects, such as sentiment or likelihood to recommend, and track these in quarterly reviews.\n* Set separate KPIs for brand-building activities to protect them from ROI-driven cuts, which may underestimate their long-term value.\n\n# 8. The 95:5 Rule\n\n*Only \\~5% of buyers are in-market; the other 95% are your future customers.*\n\nThis rule, highlighted by the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, means most people aren’t in-market at any given time. Thus, your efforts should cater to future buyers, not just immediate demand. According to research in the Journal of Marketing, consistent brand visibility primes future buyers so when they’re ready, they think of you first.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Develop evergreen brand content (videos, articles, infographics) to build awareness and capture future buyers’ attention.\n* Invest in always-on brand campaigns that keep your brand visible, even when customers aren’t actively looking to buy.\n* Segment your messaging by in-market status to better address needs of both current buyers and future prospects with tailored, engaging content.\n\n# 9. ReShare That Post\n\n*Social media feeds are a bottomless pit—reshare so people actually see your content.*\n\nWith platforms refreshing every second, a single post’s visibility is minimal. Sprout Social reports that the average organic reach of a post on Facebook, for instance, is only 5.5%. Resharing content helps maximize reach without fatiguing followers. Frequency helps visibility—just don’t overdo it.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Create a rotation schedule to re-share popular content weekly or biweekly for visibility, especially on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.\n* Use post performance data to identify top-performing posts that can be reposted or re-imagined in new formats (e.g., from carousel to video).\n* Set unique posting times for each reshare to increase the likelihood of reaching different audience segments who are active at various times.\n\n# 10. KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid\n\n*The simpler, the better.*\n\nSimplicity improves recall and reduces friction in decision-making. A study by Siegel + Gale found that brands perceived as simpler outperform others by 679% on stock indices and have higher NPS scores. The easier a message is to understand, the quicker it resonates.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Test ad copy and design for simplicity, running A/B tests to measure response on messages with fewer words and minimal visuals.\n* Focus messaging on one key value proposition per campaign, resisting the urge to cram multiple points into a single ad or email.\n* Run “clarity tests” by asking team members or outsiders to describe the ad’s value in 5 seconds or less. Simplify until it’s unmistakable.\n\n# 11. Your Brand Is What People Say It Is\n\n*Perception shapes brand identity more than your messaging.*\n\nA brand’s image depends on customer perception, not your intentions. A study by Edelman’s Trust Barometer found that 81% of consumers say trust in a brand influences their decision to buy. If customers believe one thing while you’re saying another, perception wins every time.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Conduct regular sentiment analysis on social media and review sites to gauge public perception.\n* Engage with customer feedback publicly and show how you’ve taken it to heart. Positive responses to critiques strengthen public perception of your brand.\n* Align brand messaging with actual customer experiences by coordinating closely with customer support and product teams to maintain authenticity.\n\n# 12. Reach + Frequency’s Steep Response Curve\n\n*More isn’t always better.*\n\nResearch from the Advertising Research Foundation shows that in many cases, a single, high-quality exposure is often as effective as multiple. The key is relevance and quality over sheer quantity.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Set caps on ad frequency (e.g., once or twice per user per week) to avoid overwhelming potential customers with the same content.\n* Use data to target specific audiences likely to be more responsive after a single exposure (e.g., retargeting based on interaction with past ads).\n* Optimize creatives for high-quality exposure by investing in attention-grabbing formats (e.g., video or interactive ads) that make a single viewing count.\n\n# 13. Focus on What Doesn’t Change\n\n*Trends come and go; core consumer needs don’t.*\n\nFocusing on unchanging human motivators—convenience, quality, trust—drives sustainable business. Don’t chase every trend; keep consistent and deeply informed on universal drivers.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* List your brand’s core values and use them as a foundation for messaging across campaigns, regardless of trending topics.\n* Develop marketing strategies that align with universal needs (like convenience, quality, or trust), ensuring that campaigns stay relevant over time.\n* Regularly revisit customer research to confirm that your messaging speaks to lasting needs rather than transient desires.\n\n# 14. Demand Generation Is a Misnomer\n\n*Marketing doesn’t create demand; it primes the brand for future recall.*\n\nDemand creation is rare; demand recognition is more accurate. Research from McKinsey shows that when customers are exposed to brand messages consistently over time, their recall when in-market improves. Thus, the true job of marketing is to make your brand memorable so that when demand surfaces, you’re the natural choice. Frequent, memorable exposure places you top of mind.\n\nMAC Action Steps:\n\n* Invest in consistent messaging that builds familiarity and recognition rather than immediate sales pressure.\n* Develop awareness-building campaigns that focus on the benefits and identity of the brand, helping it stand out when customers do decide to buy.\n\nMarketing, in practice, is less about flashy tactics and more about understanding fundamental truths of human behavior and economic dynamics. If you stick to these heuristics, you’re far more likely to engage customers meaningfully and build a brand that lasts.\n\nWhat heuristics would YOU add to the list?

Apologies in advance for the length.\n\nBackstory: I’m the eldest of 4 sisters. We’re stair stepped, 2 years apart. I’m Meg, 38, Jo is 36, Beth is 34, and Amy is 32.\n\nOur parents used to joke about how they kept trying for a boy but finally gave up after girl number 4. Not gonna lie, it hurt our feelings a little - especially Amy - but they stopped that and assured us they wouldn’t change anything.\n\nEvery one us has at least 1 daughter. I am the only sister that has a son. At 17, he’s the eldest grandchild and I’m fairly certain he’s my dad’s favorite person in the world. They are best friends. It’s adorable.\n\nOk now that you have the backstory/fam history, let’s talk about tonight.\n\nMy son, who is VERY intelligent, and absolutely crushed high school, recently received his acceptance letter to a pretty prestigious university. Full ride. We are incredibly proud. My folks wanted to throw him a little congratulatory party, and tonight worked for all of our schedules (which is no small feat - 4 different families with 11 kids between them), so we all headed to the folks house for pizza and cake.\n\nAt one point, Amy brought up that it is sibling appreciation day, and Mom said she wanted all of her girls to say what we appreciate about our sisters, and we go youngest to eldest - with most of the compliments going to me, as I was kind of a second mom to them. I told each of my sisters how much I loved them, among other things, and then finished my speech off saying something like “and I REALLY appreciate that we didn’t have any gross boys stinking up our house!” All of us but Beth and her husband laugh. Beth’s eyes got really big and her husband (Chase) looked at me like I was something he scraped off the bottom of his shoe.\n\nSuddenly, he says “that’s pretty f\\*cked up.” I said something like “Idk Chase, I’ve smelled you after your workouts - it’s pretty bad,” and he got even more mad and said “how could you talk about Tyler like that?” And Beth starts LOSING HER MIND, guys. She’s grabbing him by the arm and begging him to hush, saying they need to go home now, etc. So naturally I’m like “umm who is Tyler?”\n\nWell, friends. APPARENTLY Tyler is Beth’s twin that died during childbirth. And it made our folks and me so depressed that nobody is allowed to speak of him or reference him, EVER. Beth forbade him from ever mentioning to ANY family member. After Chase told us this, nobody said a word. It was so damn tense. Finally, I just kind of bluntly said, hi Mo “I’m not sure why, but Beth lied to you about this. I think you guys should talk about it, but I don’t want to hear anything else about this tonight, as we’re here to celebrate (my) son.”\n\nAfter that, Beth burst into tears and ran into her old bedroom, with Chase, Mom, and Jo following her. The party never fully recovered and they took off pretty shortly after that. I stayed behind to help clean, and so my dad and son could hang some more. While I’m doing the dishes, my mom scolded me pretty harshly about calling Beth a liar. IF THE BABY SHOE FITS, MOTHER. My dad said I wasn’t wrong, but I embarrassed Beth.\n\nWhat the hell was I supposed to do? I was getting chastised over a lie!! Absolutely not. Beth also texted me that I “f\\*cked her over,” and a text from Chase’s phone told me I was the actual liar sister and everyone knows that.\n\nAmy is on my side, but she and Beth always butted heads. Jo claims she’s neutral, but she also told me I “didn’t have to call her out like that.”\n\nWhat the hell else was I supposed to do? Just take the lashing? And why is everyone acting like me calling out, what I consider to be a pretty heavy lie, is worse than the lie itself? How do we resolve this situation? I love my sisters so damn much - they are my best friends - but this is so weird and so wrong to put on me.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** I can’t imagine any other response. I really can’t. Were you seriously expected to lie along with her? I think that is shocking.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I have NO idea what she was expecting??? I have “lied” for her before. But saying she’s at my house while she’s really getting boudoir photos done for him is not the same as lying about a whole person who never existed??? It’s beyond bizarre.\n\n**Commenter 2:** I'm kind of impressed that after all of that she managed to convince her husband that you were the liar. Of course, if he still believes her he's dumb as a brick. I'd think there is proof enough on her birth certificate as it will state she was a single birth.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I will say, Chase is not a dummy, and he’s typically not malicious. And although nobody really backed me up about this being a lie (at least not in front of me), I think it’s pretty obvious that I was telling the truth, as everyone else was obviously confused and dead silent in the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have not responded to the texts, as I’m not looking to burn bridges. I’ve made many mistakes, and my sisters have graciously forgiven me. I’m just,..flummoxed. And a little hurt.\n\n**Commenter 3:** This is very weird. I’m confused at why your parents aren’t embarrassed by your sister’s behavior. Especially trying to keep up the lie afterwards and saying you’re lying. Is she mentally ok? Does she have a history of lying?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We all lied as kids, but I assumed she grew out of it as an adult. We also all exhibited some attention seeking behavior, but again, age appropriate, especially for a family with 4 kids and 2 parents who worked full time.\n&gt; \n&gt; My parents are hippies and very much “live and let live,” kinda vibe. But this feels… icky to me. So I’m a little surprised they’re not more upset about it? Then again, they never “punished” us in front of each other, so they could be dealing with, or planning to deal with the situation behind the scenes. Either way, Beth is WAY too old to be making up dead sibling stories.\n\n**Commenter 4:** Your sister dug herself a weird hole, is now mad she has to dig her way out of it, and is placing that anger on you for accidentally handing her the shovel. If she wants to blame anyone for being caught in a lie she can look in the mirror. How do you fix it? Your sister has to pull her head out of her ass and apologize for putting you all in that position, and then you can think about apologizing for being “blunt” about it.\n\n(But tbh, I don’t feel you did anything wrong exactly here. You had no idea what was going on, why you were being accused of being a bad person, and literally just wanted the focus back on your son’s achievements. It’s not like you accidentally spilled a secret you were supposed to keep. Your sister created this entire mess and should probably explain to you guys why she did it)\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I appreciate your input and kind words! I don’t like drama, so I find it best to just kinda stop it in its tracks. And my son…we recently got an autism diagnosis (what was formerly referred to as Asperger’s), and it’s messed with his head a little. He’s always been so bad socially, and really struggled making friends. As a result, his cousins got the bulk of the attention. He was really proud of himself and I wanted him to remember this little get together because it was all about HIM for once.\n\n**Commenter 5:** Your sister is a freak weirdo. Making up a dead twin for what? Sympathy? Attention? She fucked up and everyone knows it. Why anyone would want to cover up her lie is beyond me. She made her bed. Let her deal with the repercussions of this outrageous lie. Question though. Did or have your parents tried to set the record straight with her idiot hubby or are they staying silent about this alleged twin baby that never existed?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** When I told Chase she was lying, nobody backed me up, but I believe it was kind of obvious bc nobody refuted my claims. That coupled with Beth frantically trying to get her husband to leave…Chase is smart. He can put 2&amp;2 together.\n&gt; \n&gt; I mentioned in another comment that our parents never punished us (nor really got onto us) in front of each other. So I would like to think they’re handling things on that end behind the scenes, and trying to appeal to my dislike of drama and empathy to get me to forgive her.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don’t find the lie unforgivable. I think it’s bizarre and I don’t appreciate it, but I don’t think our relationship is over. I love her. I took her on her first date (took her and a boy to get ice cream and they held hands - we lied to our parents about that one). I helped take care of her when she was postpartum bc Chase had to work. She’s got my heart, ya know?\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 6:** Just to be clear you do recognize this level of lie as a mental health disorder correct? While I am not a therapist this very much sounds like some strain of Munchhausens. Again not a therapist just therapy adjacent in training and work so I have some familiarity, so get her some professional help. This isn’t just a cry for help, this is a sign of a broken brain that requires professional help and maybe even medical interventions.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** I work in healthcare, albeit not directly in the mental health field, but I am a little familiar with various disorders. I actually do think she’s a hypochondriac. One of my nieces is ALWAYS coming down with something (they are not), or my sister definitely has Crohn’s disease (she doesn’t). She won’t drink milk if it’s within 3 days of the Best Buy date. Refuses bread pudding bc you use “old bread” to make them. Won’t eat brownies I baked from scratch the day before bc they’re old…\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; So I know she’s got some issues. But hey, WE ALL HAVE ISSUES. I’m pretty emotionally closed off except to my spouse and children. Some people think that makes me a b-. I try not to be too judgmental bc I’m definitely not perfect, but I’m judging the f out of this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/aG6u5bGjDS): **April 12, 2025 (next day)** \n\nOk, I think we have some answers re: the events that occurred last night. I do want to tell everyone who took time to give advice or kind words, thank you. I honestly couldn’t read everything - I was (and am) exhausted. But I did get an idea of how I wanted to approach everything, thanks to the advice given. My post says it was removed, and I’m unsure why, so hopefully this one will stay.\n\nI’ll get to the update in a few. I just wanted to answer some FAQ/comments real quick:\n\n1 - this is fake! I WISH IT WAS. I really wish my mind worked in a way where I could make things up like this. Alas, my imagination is lacking.\n\n2 - your parents named you after Little Women? This is probably partially to blame for the “fake” comments. These are just placeholder names I used, as there are 4 sisters in that novel. My parents are hippies, and gave us some pretty noticeable names. If I used our real ones, on the off chance any of our friends read this, they’d know immediately this was our family.\n\n3 - Beth is continuing to lie and Chase is believing it and your mom and Jo threw you under the bus too! Re: Chase, I think he knew I was being truthful. Also, I said the text came from his phone. I was actually thinking Beth sent it, as that’s not Chase’s vibe. About mom &amp; Jo - they didn’t throw me under the bus. But I’ll go into more detail soon.\n\n4 - Is it possible my mom had twins and I just forgot or didn’t know about the death? Absolutely not. I was at all of my sisters births. I don’t remember Jo’s, but I do remember Beth &amp; Amy’s, and there were no multiples, no deaths, no funerals, no depression.\n\n5 - The birth certificate will prove it! It sure would, yes. But I’m not about to try to strong arm my sister into showing her husband her birth certificate.\n\n6 - Your sister is mentally ill, also the golden child, and you’re the scapegoat. I’m not about to say my sister is sick, but I do think she has some issues - as we all do. There’s no golden child and scapegoat in this family. My parents were and are really good about treating all of us fairly and equally.\n\n7 - You could have/should have been more tactful/pulled her aside/not called her a liar. Had I known that “Tyler” was my dead brother, I never would’ve asked who he was. Chase and I tease each other a lot, and I honestly thought he was about to come out with some kind of funny joke, alá “deez nuts.” Re: my lack of tact? Idk, I think it’s pretty lacking in tact to make up a whole dead sibling. And really, facts are facts. She lied, and that’s that. The night was about my son, so I squashed the issue and chose to move forward, hoping to end the conversation with as little drama as possible.\n\nOk so now up to the update:\n\nAfter a night of barely sleeping and my blood pressure dangerously high, I called my mom this morning fully ready to let out an emotionally charged tirade about how I feel they unfairly threw me under the bus and took Beth’s side when she OBJECTIVELY did the worse thing\n\nMy mom answered the phone apologizing and asked me to just listen. When she and Jo followed Beth &amp; Chase to Beth’s room, Mom did tell Chase that Tyler was not real, and this is an issue between her and Chase, and they should probably leave, because she didn’t want the evening ruined. She did “get onto me,” but it was mostly out of sympathy and empathy for Beth, and she recognized it wasn’t ok. She apologized for that.\n\nShe spoke with Chase this morning, and Beth (who is the one who sent me the text from Chase’s phone) finally came clean early this morning, after HOURS of denying the lie. Something I didn’t mention, as I didn’t feel it was pertinent to the story, is Beth’s eldest daughter (Madison) isn’t Chase’s biological daughter. He’s been around since Madison was 2. Also kind of pertinent, is that Chase is a first responder. He loves to be a hero. And he’s very good in that role. He met Beth doing victims advocacy. And as such, I believe they both view him as “saving,” Beth. This has a long been speculated, but it’s not exactly our place to say anything. And we all love Chase. He is an amazing person.\n\nAnd Beth is no dummy. She picked up on Chase’s hero complex immediately. It appears that, in an effort to make herself look more….sympathetic? Vulnerable? Broken? She lied about having a twin brother that died in childbirth. I guess being in an abusive relationship and having a small child just wasn’t enough?? She did not have to do that. They’ve been together 10 years now, and not once did she come clean. To me that proves a clear pattern of deceit and manipulation. However, I’m not going to speculate on her mental health problems or reasonings for not coming clean. That is for her and her husband to deal with.\n\nNeither one of them have called or texted me to apologize, and I’m honestly unsure if they will. Beth is more of the rug sweeping type, while I’m a confront issues head on type. I will not be cutting my sister off for this, though. I love her, and at the end of the day I just want her to be happy and healthy. I do hope that this whole issue will cause her to rethink some of her life choices and maybe she can get some therapy. I think we could all use therapy, tbh.\n\nThat’s where we are right now. My mom did not offer any information about how Beth and Chase are doing, and I did not ask. It’s not my business. I have not heard from Jo, but Amy and I have been texting all morning and she is being my best good friend right now and providing a lot of support. Hopefully we can all move forward and grow together in the future.\n\nThanks again for the support you all have sent my way.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** I am glad your mother apologized, but your sister really owes you - and the entire family - an apology. This was a really selfish and weird thing to do. She also owes Chase and his family an apology. I hope she gets some help for this. Good luck.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Your sister could probably benefit from therapy. I will never understand why people think it’s a good idea to lie about something so easily disproven. Don’t lie about anything and you won’t have situations blow up like this. I hope she comes to her senses and apologizes to you.\n\n**Commenter 3:** I think your family needs to do a sit down with your sister because this isn't normal behavior at all. She lied for 10 YEARS ABOUT A DEAD BROTHER! Y'all need to call this behavior out since she's wayyyy too old to be acting like this. And doing nothing is showing her that you guys will accept similar or the same type of behavior in the future.\n\n**Commenter 4:** Welp this is why she continues to do this nonsense at her big ass age. No one holds her accountable. You can’t move forward and grow together if people don’t take accountability.\n\nYour entire family enables her in the worst way\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n#----NEW UPDATE----\n\n[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/MYSUHy3GwJ): **September 21, 2025 (five months later)**\n\nTW: &gt;!death of a loved one, grief, depression, divorce!&lt;\n\nWell. A lot has happened in the past months. I read all your comments. Multiple times. And I heard you. I faced some very hard truths about my family and our dynamics. But mostly I grieved.\n\nAbout a month after I made my original post, my dad passed away. It was very unexpected. Massive stroke. The worst part was mom was out of town, so my dad died alone. My son talked to him that same day. They made plans for the next week. And then…my dad was gone.\n\nIt’s been a very hard few months. I started therapy mostly to deal with navigating life without dad, but my therapist made a lot of good points about our family dynamic. Mostly that I was parentified and a people pleaser. That “keeping the peace” comes at a price. And that price was my needs being put on the back burner. And as a result I keep people at an arms length bc of this. And I’ll be damned if she wasn’t right.\n\nSo let’s rewind a little. During the week or so after dad died, mom was lost (they’ve been married over 40 years, so no surprise there), and as the eldest sibling, I stepped up big time. Jo and I already knew a little about our parents end of life wishes, and we chose to go forward with cremation. Mom agreed (this is her wish as well), as did Amy. Guess who didn’t? If you guessed Beth…you’d be right. She just had a complete meltdown, wailing over how she couldn’t stand the thought and will NOT allow it, and blah blah blah.\n\nThis is probably the first instance of me shutting her ass down. I told her, in NO uncertain terms, that this wasn’t her choice, it was our father’s preference, and it was happening regardless. Next, she was wandering thru the house, trying to pick out shit she wanted, before mom had even given us her blessing. When she started, mom asked her to please stop, let her sort some stuff first, and then she will give a yes or no. When Beth asked what she needed to “sort out,” Mom mentioned dad’s watch collection. There was one specifically for my son, and when Beth inquired as to which one, mom refused to answer. Beth insisted that wasn’t fair, she should have first pick, blah blah blah. Mom and Jo apparently shut that shit down with a quickness. I wasn’t there, but my son is now wearing the first “luxury” watch, my dad ever bought, and he is so proud. Don’t worry though, - all the grands have something special.\n\nNext, she got absolutely plastered at his end of life ceremony, went around wailing and making literally the whole thing about her grief and how her wishes weren’t respected, and before I could snap (and believe me, I was THIS CLOSE), Chase dragged her ass out of venue and I’m not sure what happened, but when they got home, police were called, Beth was arrested, and my niece ended up with my mom for the night. My BIL did have some bruises to back him up. Despite Beth calling us…nobody bailed her ass out. We are just DONE with it.\n\nShe did get released on her own recognizance, and only ended up with some community service and a fine. Chase was more than willing to do therapy with her, but she started drinking even more, and as result is being more aggressive with both him and the kids. There was another situation, and long story short, Chase is divorcing her and petitioning for full custody. He has asked us to write letters on his behalf, and I believe all of us are going to do so. I don’t know what is going on with my sister, but she is on a downward spiral and it’s so sad to see. She refuses to speak with anyone, and I’m just done trying. I’d already decided to cut her off after the bullshit at dad’s end of life ceremony, but this solidified it.\n\nI won’t be updating again. I’m washing my hands of all of this. I hope my sister gets help, but it’ll take a lot of work, and she’s never been one to want to put in the work. I’m putting myself first, for ONCE, and concentrating on my children, my husband, and MYSELF.\n\nThanks for listening to me vent. Y’all are almost as good as therapy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",
