## üöÄ How to Use the Workshop

### Step 1: Run Data Collection

```bash
# Collect data (takes 3-5 minutes)
npm run workshop "your topic here" --audience executive --sources 15

# Or use cached data from previous run
# It will prompt you to reuse cache if available
```

The system will:
1. Search 6 query variations across multiple sources
2. Scrape and cache content locally
3. Use Claude to extract statistics, case studies, insights, quotes
4. Cache everything in `.cache/workshop/`

### Step 2: Review the Data

Check what was collected:
```bash
# View organized data
cat .cache/workshop/your-topic-organized.json | jq .
```

Or use the interactive commands (if running in terminal):
- `stats` - See all statistics
- `cases` - Review case studies
- `insights` - View key themes
- `quotes` - See executive quotes

### Step 3: Craft Your Content

Now you have two options:

#### Option A: Use Claude Code Interactively

```bash
claude code

# Then ask:
"Help me write an enterprise AI ROI analysis.
I have 25 statistics, 4 case studies, and 11 insights cached.
Let's start with a compelling hook."
```

Work section-by-section:
1. Draft hook (2-3 sentences with surprising stat)
2. Write "The Stakes" (why this matters NOW)
3. Create "The Discovery" (your unique insight)
4. Build "The Proof" (case studies with metrics)
5. Explain "The Method" (how-to playbook)
6. Describe "The Payoff" (outcomes they'll achieve)
7. Add CTA

#### Option B: Use Workshop's Draft Commands

The workshop has built-in section drafters:
- `draft hook` - Generate compelling opening

2. Add your voice and expertise
3. Check against CLAUDE.md quality checklist
4. Format as Astro page
5. Publish!

### Speed Up Future Content
- Cache is your friend - rerun same topic to use cached data
- Build a data library - keep organized.json files
- Template your structure - reuse what works

## üîß Troubleshooting

**"Some sources failed to scrape"**
- Normal! Many sites block scrapers
- Workshop continues with successful sources
- 5-8 good sources is enough for great content

**"Claude analysis is slow"**
- Each source takes ~5 seconds to analyze
- 15 sources = ~75 seconds total
- This is normal, grab coffee ‚òï

**"Interactive mode crashed"**
- Run in foreground, not background
- Or just use the cached data with `claude code`
- Data is saved in `.cache/workshop/`

**"I want to add more sources"**
- Delete cache file: `rm .cache/workshop/your-topic-*`
- Run again with `--sources 20`

## üìÇ File Locations

```
.cache/workshop/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-topic-sources.json        # Raw scraped content
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your-topic-organized.json      # Organized by theme

workshop-output/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your-topic-wip.json            # Your work in progress
```
