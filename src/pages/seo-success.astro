                Based on Fortune 500 case studies: Average ROI is 333% within 90 days when done right. SoFi saw 509% traffic growth leading to 22,000+ funded accounts. Adobe exceeded goals by 73% with 25,000+ downloads. Bank of America, NetApp, and Toyota all reported transformative results.

                The key difference: Enterprise SEO focuses on revenue, not rankings. We prioritize high-converting pages, implement at scale, and tie everything to business KPIs.

                Most SEO fails because of three critical mistakes: 1) Chasing vanity metrics instead of revenue, 2) Following generic "best practices" instead of data-driven strategy, 3) Endless audits without clear action plans.

                Our approach is different: We analyze what's actually working in your industry, prioritize quick wins that drive revenue, and create a roadmap your team can execute. No 200-page audits, just a clear plan that works.

I've spent 16+ years leading SEO for major brands, building scalable SEO strategies that drive real revenue. The results I've shared are achievable with the right focus, resources, and execution. Most businesses start by seeing small but meaningful improvements, then scale as their SEO strategy compounds. This sprint is designed to get you on the right path fast, so you're no longer guessing what's working and what's not. SEO is simple, but it's not easy‚Äîlet's make sure you're investing in what actually moves the needle.
