        The Truth: AI Isn't Replacing Marketers Who Adapt
      </h2>

      <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 rounded-r-lg mb-8">
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Key Finding from 105 Comments:</p>
        <p class="text-blue-800">
          Not a single verified case of AI directly replacing a marketer. Every reported job loss was due to:
          Budget cuts (unrelated to AI), company restructuring, or refusal to adapt to new tools.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p>
          After analyzing discussions from 280+ marketers, the pattern is clear: AI is transforming roles, not eliminating them.
          The marketers thriving are those who've embraced AI as a tool, not a threat.
        </p>

        <h3>What's Actually Happening:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Productivity Explosion:</strong> Marketers using AI report 70% productivity gains</li>
          <li><strong>Role Evolution:</strong> Focus shifting from execution to strategy</li>
          <li><strong>Skill Premium:</strong> AI-skilled marketers commanding 25% higher salaries</li>
          <li><strong>New Opportunities:</strong> Entirely new roles emerging (AI prompt engineers, AI strategists)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Real Risk:</h3>
        <p>
          The only marketers at risk are those refusing to adapt. As one commenter with 45 upvotes noted:
          <em>"The marketer who uses AI will replace the marketer who doesn't."</em>
