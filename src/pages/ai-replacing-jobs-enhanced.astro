        "content": "AI Top 19 Predictions from Experts on AI Job Loss Sıla Ermut updated on Sep 8, 2025 See our ethical norms AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years. The shift will occur rapidly, with job losses affecting the global workforce sooner than previous waves of technological change. By 2027, millions of jobs may be displaced or significantly altered. While some roles will evolve, the workforce must prepare for a sharp increase in disrupted employment. We gathered 19 predictions from AI experts, academic articles, and industry leaders on their perceptions of AI job loss. AI job loss predictions according to experts Notes: The size of the plots is correlated with the job loss prediction. The percentages referenced in our analysis are derived based on assumptions concerning overall job displacement. In specific scenarios, these assumptions included potential job gains resulting from the adoption of AI technologies. However, to maintain consistency in evaluating net job loss, any estimated job gains have been explicitly excluded from the calculation. As a result, the final percentages presented reflect net job loss figures , ensuring a more conservative and focused interpretation of the potential impact on the workforce due to AI implementation. Geoffrey Hinton, Computer Scientist, 2025 Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel Prize–winning computer scientist known as the “godfather of AI,” warned that artificial intelligence will increase unemployment while driving higher profits, a result he attributes to capitalism rather than the technology itself. He noted that while mass layoffs have not yet materialized, AI is already reducing entry-level opportunities. Hinton sees healthcare as one of the few sectors that could benefit, as efficiency gains for doctors would expand access to care. However, he dismissed universal basic income as inadequate for addressing the loss of dignity and purpose tied to work. He also cautioned about long-term risks, estimating a 10–20% chance that AI could pose an existential threat through uncontrollable superintelligence or misuse by malicious actors, while criticizing the weak regulatory efforts in the United States. 1 Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar, and Ruyu Chen: “Canaries in the Coal Mine? Six Facts about the Recent Employment Effects of Artificial Intelligence”, 2025 According to a recent article from Stanford in August 2025, AI adoption is accelerating across industries, with companies utilizing it to boost productivity and reduce costs through the automation of routine tasks. The analysis focuses on the labor market implications of widespread AI adoption, highlighting: Displacement risks for clerical, data entry, and customer support jobs that rely heavily on repetitive processes. New opportunities in oversight, data quality assurance, and human–AI collaboration roles, which are emerging alongside automation. Workforce transition needs exist, as many workers lack the technical or analytical skills required for these new positions. Charts and projections in the report indicate that by 2030, as many as 12–14% of workers may need to transition into new occupations as automation reshapes the employment landscape . Roles in healthcare, education, and AI maintenance are expected to expand, while administrative support jobs are expected to continue declining. This suggests that while AI adoption will drive economic gains and productivity growth, it is also likely to deepen inequality unless governments and employers invest significantly in reskilling, mobility support, and other interventions to ease the transition. 2 Kiran Tomlinson, Sonia Jaffe, Will Wang, Scott Counts, Siddharth Suri: “Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI” study from Microsoft, 2025 According to Microsoft research, occupations vary widely in their susceptibility to AI, with some jobs being significantly more likely to be affected than others. The study ranks roles based on an AI applicability score that combines: How much of the job AI can do (coverage). How completely it can do those tasks (completeness). The variety of tasks it can handle (scope). Jobs like interpreters, translators, historians, and customer service representatives scored highest , meaning AI can perform much of their work effectively, especially in text- or communication-heavy tasks. Conversely, occupations such as nursing assistants, dishwashers, roofers, and surgical assistants scored near zero , indicating that AI is currently not capable of taking over their primarily physical, hands-on, or human-interaction-heavy responsibilities. This suggests that while AI is rapidly advancing in automating cognitive and routine digital work, it remains limited in replacing roles that require dexterity, emotional intelligence, or real-world adaptability. 3 Eric Schmidt ( former CEO of Google ), 2025 Dr. Schmidt predicts that within one year , most programming work will be done by AI. Tools using reinforcement learning and planning are evolving rapidly. These systems can write, debug, and optimize code better than most humans, especially for routine or complex but repetitive tasks. AI is also expected to reach the level of top graduate mathematicians in the near future. Schmidt explains that AI models now operate well in mathematical reasoning because math has a simpler, structured language. With tools like Lean theorem proving, AI can solve and verify complex mathematical problems. 4 Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO), 2025 Dario Amodei warned that AI could eliminate 50% of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, potentially pushing U.S. unemployment rates to 10–20% . Calling it a possible “white-collar bloodbath,” Amodei emphasized that many CEOs remain unaware of AI’s short-term disruptive power. His message focused on the urgency for lawmakers to act and for AI developers and companies to adopt transparent approaches. He acknowledged that AI continues to offer long-term promise, but stressed that dangerous short-term pain, particularly for junior professionals, must not be ignored. Entry-level roles involving structured tasks performed routinely by humans are seen as most vulnerable to automation in this scenario. Kai-Fu Lee (Venture Capitalist), 2025 Kai-Fu Lee echoed Amodei’s concern by validating the projection that AI could displace 50% of jobs by 2027 . As a prominent voice in the field, his agreement adds credibility to the estimate that AI job loss could soon impact half of the global workforce. While his statement is brief, it underscores growing consensus among experts that AI may reshape employment far more aggressively than previous technological change. 5 International Monetary Fund (IMF), 2024 The IMF estimated that 300 million full-time jobs globally could be affected by AI-related automation . However, it emphasized that most will undergo task-level transformation, rather than outright loss. In high-income countries, service-heavy economies make the workforce especially exposed. The report classified AI’s effects into three categories: automatable (routine, rule-based), augmentable (judgment-driven), and unaffected tasks. Two-thirds of jobs are expected to experience partial automation. It emphasized the complementarity of AI and human labor, particularly in decision-making, pattern recognition, and knowledge retrieval. The report also highlighted the urgent need for reskilling, projecting that over 40% of workers will require significant upskilling by 2030. Legal , financial , and insurance sectors will undergo the most significant transformation; education and healthcare will remain relatively resistant due to their reliance on human interaction and complex processes. 6 Goldman Sachs, 2023 Goldman Sachs forecasted that 300 million jobs worldwide could be lost or degraded due to AI. The most impacted regions would be the U.S. and Europe, particularly in industries relying on repetitive, structured tasks. Despite this, Sachs also predicted that artificial intelligence could increase global GDP by 7%, thereby creating new job opportunities and fields. Drawing historical parallels with electric motors and personal computers, the report framed AI as another general-purpose technology, likely to bring both disruption and long-term benefits. The challenge, however, remains managing this transition without causing deep societal harm, particularly in vulnerable labor segments. 7 World Economic Forum (Future of Jobs Report), 2023 The World Economic Forum projected that 83 million jobs would be lost and 69 million created by 2027, amounting to a net loss of 14 million jobs (2% of the global workforce). Clerical and administrative roles like bank tellers, cashiers, and data entry clerks are most at risk. On the other hand, roles involving AI development, business intelligence, cybersecurity, and sustainability are expected to grow. While 60% of companies plan to adopt AI by 2027, 26% anticipate job growth from it, and half expect job losses. The report also noted that climate transition policies could affect around 10% of jobs, adding a second axis of change alongside technological pressure. 8 GPTs and the U.S. Workforce (Eloundou et al.), 2023 A study on the effects of generative AI and large language models concluded that 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their tasks affected . For around 19% of workers , at least half of their daily tasks could be disrupted. The most exposed roles include writers, public relations specialists, legal secretaries, mathematicians, and tax preparers, all requiring extensive language or logic-based work. Unlike past automation, which primarily targeted blue-collar work, LLMs are poised to transform higher-wage, highly educated professions across multiple sectors. Their impact is independent of physical infrastructure, broadening the scale of potential displacement. 9 Eric Dahlin (U.S. Survey Study), 2022 A 2021 survey by sociologist Eric Dahlin found that approximately 14% of Americans reported losing their jobs to robots . Despite this modest actual rate, public perception was significantly inflated: those not affected believed 29% had lost their jobs to automation, while those who were displaced estimated the rate at 47%. This gap between perception and experience reflects deep anxiety about AI’s impact, even when real-world job loss rates remain lower than often assumed. The study’s inclusion of robots in non-industrial contexts (airports, libraries, eldercare) further highlighted AI’s reach across different sectors of life and work. Expand Image Figure 1: The graph illustrates that respondents significantly overestimated the likelihood of robot-driven job loss, with perceptions ranging from 29% to 47%, compared to the actual rate of approximately 14%. 10 World Economic Forum, 2020 In a 2020 report, the WEF predicted that 85 million jobs would be displaced , while 97 million would be created by 2025, suggesting a net gain of 12 million jobs . However, the report also introduced the idea of “double disruption,” where automation and the pandemic together accelerate job displacement beyond the ability of societies to adapt. It warned that many emerging markets and cities lacked the digital infrastructure or policy agility needed to manage AI’s growing influence on the job market. 11 PwC (22nd Annual Global CEO Survey), 2019 PwC’s global CEO survey found that 42% of CEOs believe AI will displace more jobs than it creates, while 39% disagree, reflecting a divided outlook. Job loss concerns are highest in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in China, where 88% of CEOs expect net job displacement. The report highlights a persistent skills gap, with 55% citing the inability to innovate due to a lack of key skills. Most CEOs (46%) view retraining and upskilling as the most effective solution. Despite 85% agreeing AI will significantly change business within five years, 10% have adopted it at scale, hindered by talent shortages and data challenges. 12 OECD Study, 2016 An OECD study found that 9% of UK jobs were at high risk of automation , but that 35% would undergo radical transformation in the next two decades. This conclusion suggests that fears of mass unemployment may be overstated and that significant changes are more likely to occur through job evolution and reskilling, rather than widespread elimination. 13 Bowles (EU Jobs Risk), 2014 Building on Frey and Osborne’s methodology, Bowles estimated that 54% of jobs in the European Union were at risk of computerization. This emphasized how AI’s impact extends beyond U.S. borders and raised questions about how regional differences in labor protections and education systems might shape the outcomes of technological disruption. 14 Frey &amp; Osborne, 2013 In one of the first major academic studies on AI job loss, Frey and Osborne estimated that 47% of U.S. jobs were at risk of computerization . Their research classified occupations based on their susceptibility to machine learning and automation. This early work helped frame later debates on the future of employment, drawing attention to how tasks rather than entire jobs are automated, prompting nuanced discussions around task restructuring and skills transition. 15 Other views on AI job losses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s view on AI job loss At VivaTech 2025 in Paris, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s warning that AI could replace up to half of entry-level office jobs within five years. Huang rejected the idea that AI is so dangerous or powerful that a select few should develop it, instead arguing for open and responsible advancement. While he acknowledged AI will transform the workplace, making some jobs obsolete, he emphasized that greater productivity typically leads to more hiring, not less, and criticized the fear-driven narrative surrounding AI’s impact on employment. 16 “Exponentially bad move”: Dilan Eren (Ivey Business School), 2025 While not focused on percentages, Professor Dilan Eren offered a structural critique of firms that respond to AI by eliminating junior roles. Eren warned that cutting entry-level positions for cost savings is an “exponentially bad move” that threatens the internal talent pipeline. Without juniors, organizations risk shortages of experienced staff in the coming years, especially as mentorship and on-the-job learning decline. Eren urged firms to develop strategies that support dual development: juniors must build domain expertise, while senior staff must upskill in AI. Delegating all tasks to machines, Eren argued, risks undermining judgment and weakening collaborative learning within companies. Positive outlook: Ravi Kumar (Cognizant CEO), 2025 In contrast, Ravi Kumar presented an optimistic vision of AI’s role in employment. He argued that AI will create more job opportunities , especially for recent graduates. As more companies adopt advanced software, he expects an increase in demand for skilled labor rather than widespread job losses . According to Kumar, AI can act as a force multiplier, enabling workers to achieve “more for less” while raising expectations, not reducing them. His forecast aligns AI’s rise with productivity, innovation, and new skills acquisition, challenging the notion that AI must necessarily lead to unemployment or widespread displacement. 17 The future of entry-level jobs While graduate job anxiety around AI is understandable, the dramatic 67% drop in UK graduate job postings since 2022 (43% in the US) appears driven primarily by economic uncertainty, post-COVID normalization, and accelerated offshoring rather than AI displacement. According to a recent Financial Times article, jobs have fallen sharply even in low AI-exposure sectors like HR (77%) and civil engineering (55%), suggesting broader economic factors are at play. MIT’s David Autor points to political turmoil and government cuts as more significant drivers, while LinkedIn’s chief economist emphasizes macroeconomic uncertainty as the primary cause. Although AI will likely transform work in the coming years, current evidence shows weak correlations between AI-vulnerable occupations and actual job losses; some AI-exposed fields, like accounting, are growing in youth employment. The real challenges appear to be traditional economic pressures: inflation, higher interest rates, business uncertainty, and accelerated offshoring enabled by remote work capabilities. This makes the “AI is killing graduate jobs” narrative premature despite legitimate future concerns about technological disruption. 18 Research initiatives to understand the impact of AI job loss Anthropic launches Economic Futures Program to address AI’s workforce impact Anthropic has introduced the Economic Futures Program, a new initiative designed to explore the economic effects of artificial intelligence, particularly its impact on jobs, productivity, and long-term value creation. The program aims to provide data-driven insights and develop policy proposals that address both the risks and opportunities AI presents to the global economy. Responding to job displacement risks As a response to CEO Dario Amodei’s recent predictions, the program focuses on understanding these shifts and preparing for significant workforce impact, including the need for reskilling in affected sectors. Key components of the program include: Research grants: Anthropic is offering rapid grants of up to $50,000 for short-term empirical studies on the economic impact of AI. Research can focus on labor market effects, productivity changes, or the creation of new forms of value. Policy development forums: Anthropic will host symposia in Washington, D.C., and Europe to gather policy ideas from diverse perspectives. Topics include reskilling strategies, job creation in AI-driven economies, and transitions in workflows. Data infrastructure: Building on its Economic Index launched earlier this year, Anthropic will expand its datasets to track AI’s usage and long-term effects on economic structures and employment trends. Anthropic’s program focuses more on potential job loss and mitigation strategies. The Economic Futures Program reflects a growing effort among tech companies to take responsibility for the disruption they help create, while also supporting inclusive economic growth. This initiative places special emphasis on understanding labor market transitions, identifying areas for reskilling, and creating a framework for managing AI’s evolving economic role. 19 Implications of AI on different industries Most exposed roles and industries Industries that rely on structured tasks performed routinely by humans face the highest risk. Clerical, legal, finance, and data processing roles are among the most vulnerable. These jobs are typically easy to automate using AI systems and tools. Tasks that involve predictable patterns or follow fixed rules are most susceptible to errors. Entry-level positions, particularly for young workers, are at high risk of being eliminated. Uneven impact across sectors Healthcare and education are less exposed due to the complexity of human interaction required. These sectors are more resistant to automation and large language models. Partial automation vs. full displacement Not all job losses will result in full unemployment. In many cases, AI will automate tasks within roles rather than remove entire jobs. Around two-thirds of current roles are expected to undergo task-level change. Workers will need to adjust to new responsibilities that require human decision-making, reasoning, and creativity. This partial automation still creates pressure on workers to adapt quickly. Economic and geographic variation The impact of artificial intelligence will vary by region. High-income economies with service-heavy job markets are more exposed. Emerging markets may face challenges due to limited access to digital infrastructure and fewer resources to reskill the workforce. The difference in local policy responses will influence how AI’s impact unfolds across the world. What are the perceptions from the actual workers? Mismatch between perception and reality Public perception of job losses is higher than the actual reported figures. While real displacement remains below 15% in recent years, workers believe a larger share of the workforce has been affected. This reflects growing anxiety about AI’s impact and the future of employment, despite actual data showing a slower pace of change. Ethical and societal implications of AI job displacement Core ethical challenges The implementation of AI in the workplace raises fundamental ethical questions that go beyond simple economic considerations. These challenges center on fairness, human dignity, and the moral obligations of organizations deploying transformative technologies that affect livelihoods and communities. Distributive justice and inequality : AI displacement affects lower-skilled workers and marginalized communities disproportionately, increasing existing socioeconomic disparities. This creates potential for a divided workforce where AI-augmented employees gain advantages while displaced workers face diminished prospects. The concentration of AI benefits among technology owners while costs fall on vulnerable populations raises fundamental questions about the fair distribution of technological progress. Algorithmic bias and discrimination : AI systems inherit biases from training data, potentially amplifying discriminatory practices in hiring, evaluation, and task allocation. These automated decisions affect employment outcomes at scale without adequate oversight mechanisms. Addressing bias requires diverse datasets, detection protocols, and regular auditing of AI systems used in employment contexts. Human autonomy : Widespread AI adoption challenges traditional concepts of work value and purpose. Workers face risks of skill degradation and professional identity loss as cognitive tasks become automated. Preserving meaningful human agency in work processes remains essential for maintaining worker dignity and ensuring technology enhances rather than replaces human capabilities. Transparency and accountability : Many AI systems operate as “black boxes,” obscuring decision-making processes that affect employment. This opacity complicates responsibility attribution when AI systems produce harmful outcomes. Clear accountability frameworks and explainable AI systems are necessary for maintaining fairness and trust in employment-related applications. Societal implications Beyond individual workplace impacts, AI-driven job displacement poses broader threats to social cohesion, economic stability, and democratic governance. Political and social stability: Large-scale displacement creates potential for political volatility and social unrest, particularly when communities perceive unequal distribution of technological benefits. Addressing these concerns requires policies that distribute AI benefits broadly across society. Intergenerational impact: Entry-level position displacement disrupts traditional career entry pathways for younger workers. This affects standard professional development models and may create barriers to career advancement for new workforce entrants. Alternative pathways for professional development and advancement need to be developed to accommodate AI’s role in the workplace. Implementation framework Addressing AI’s ethical challenges requires structured approaches that balance technological advancement with social responsibility. Here are some of the principles for organizations and policymakers to guide AI deployment while protecting affected communities and workers: Stakeholder engagement : AI deployment decisions should incorporate input from affected workers, unions, communities, and civil society organizations. Governance structures must include diverse perspectives and maintain ongoing dialogue regarding impacts and necessary adjustments. Harm mitigation : Organizations should prioritize augmentation over replacement when feasible, implementing gradual rather than abrupt transitions. Benefit distribution : AI productivity gains should extend to workers through wage increases, hour reductions, or improved conditions rather than accruing solely to capital owners. Mechanisms such as profit-sharing or worker ownership models can help ensure equitable distribution of AI-generated value across stakeholders. How to leverage AI for workforce advantage? Importance of reskilling By 2030, over 40% of workers will need to develop new skills to remain employed. As AI systems continue to evolve, companies must invest in training programs to stay competitive. Reskilling is especially important for young people entering the job market, where entry-level opportunities are shrinking. Employers must develop strategies that align humans with machines, rather than replacing them entirely. Organizational risks of cutting junior roles Firms that eliminate junior roles to reduce costs face long-term risk. Without entry-level staff, organizations lose future talent and weaken internal training structures. Mentorship and on-the-job learning decline, which impacts decision-making and institutional knowledge. While AI can automate tasks, relying solely on systems creates gaps in workforce development. Potential for economic growth Despite widespread concern, artificial intelligence could lead to long-term economic gains. Estimates suggest that AI might boost global GDP by 7%, partly offsetting job losses. This mirrors past general-purpose technologies that initially displaced workers but eventually created new jobs. However, the challenge lies in managing the short-term disruption without causing unemployment and social instability. Diverging expectations about the future Some executives expect artificial intelligence to create more job opportunities. As companies increase adoption, demand may shift toward roles involving AI development, cybersecurity, and sustainability. These jobs require new skills and align with the growth of AI, which continues to impact how businesses operate. On the other hand, many managers still expect job cuts in the near term, indicating that the outlook remains divided. FAQ What are the assumptions and predictions on AI job loss?

        "content": "Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AI&rsquo;s full potential January 28, 2025 | Report Hannah Mayer Lareina Yee Michael Chui Roger Roberts Almost all companies invest in AI, but just 1 percent believe they are at maturity. Our research finds the biggest barrier to scaling is not employees&mdash;who are ready&mdash;but leaders, who are not steering fast enough. Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AI’s full potential (47 pages) Artificial intelligence has arrived in the workplace and has the potential to be as transformative as the steam engine was to the 19th-century Industrial Revolution. 1 “ Gen AI: A cognitive industrial revolution ,” McKinsey, June 7, 2024. With powerful and capable large language models (LLMs) developed by Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, and others, we have entered a new information technology era. McKinsey research sizes the long-term AI opportunity at $4.4 trillion in added productivity growth potential from corporate use cases. 2 “ The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier ,” McKinsey, June 14, 2023. Therein lies the challenge: the long-term potential of AI is great, but the short-term returns are unclear. Over the next three years, 92 percent of companies plan to increase their AI investments. But while nearly all companies are investing in AI, only 1 percent of leaders call their companies “mature” on the deployment spectrum, meaning that AI is fully integrated into workflows and drives substantial business outcomes. The big question is how business leaders can deploy capital and steer their organizations closer to AI maturity. This research report, prompted by Reid Hoffman’s book Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future , 3 Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato, Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future , Authors Equity, January 2025. asks a similar question: How can companies harness AI to amplify human agency and unlock new levels of creativity and productivity in the workplace? AI could drive enormous positive and disruptive change. This transformation will take some time, but leaders must not be dissuaded. Instead, they must advance boldly today to avoid becoming uncompetitive tomorrow. The history of major economic and technological shifts shows that such moments can define the rise and fall of companies. Over 40 years ago, the internet was born. Since then, companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft have attained trillion-dollar market capitalizations. Even more profoundly, the internet changed the anatomy of work and access to information. AI now is like the internet many years ago: The risk for business leaders is not thinking too big, but rather too small. This report explores companies’ technology and business readiness for AI adoption (see sidebar “About the survey”). It concludes that employees are ready for AI. The biggest barrier to success is leadership. Register for McKinsey Live: From Strategy to Performance: How Leaders Can Build an Operating Model That Works Tuesday, September 30 | 10:30 a.m. EDT / 4:30 p.m. CEST In today&rsquo;s rapidly changing environment, shaped by digital disruption, shifting customer expectations, and new ways of working, traditional operating models no longer suffice. Business leaders must rethink how their organizations create value, adapt quickly, and empower talent. Join McKinsey senior partners Alexis Krivkovich and Brooke Weddle as they share a research-backed approach to organizational design, including the &ldquo;nine golden rules&rdquo; for transforming operating models and building capabilities that last. Register About the survey To create our report, we surveyed 3,613 employees (managers and independent contributors) and 238 C-level executives in October and November 2024. Of these, 81 percent came from the United States, and the rest came from five other countries: Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. The employees spanned many roles, including business development, finance, marketing, product management, sales, and technology. All the survey findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses and those from other regions. Chapter 1 looks at the rapid advancement of technology over the past two years and its implications for business adoption of AI. Chapter 2 delves into the attitudes and perceptions of employees and leaders. Our research shows that employees are more ready for AI than their leaders imagine. In fact, they are already using AI on a regular basis; are three times more likely than leaders realize to believe that AI will replace 30 percent of their work in the next year; and are eager to gain AI skills. Still, AI optimists are only a slight majority in the workplace; a large minority (41 percent) are more apprehensive and will need additional support. This is where millennials, who are the most familiar with AI and are often in managerial roles, can be strong advocates for change. Chapter 3 looks at the need for speed and safety in AI deployment. While leaders and employees want to move faster, trust and safety are top concerns. About half of employees worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will get AI right. The onus is on business leaders to prove them right, by making bold and responsible decisions. Chapter 4 examines how companies risk losing ground in the AI race if leaders do not set bold goals. As the hype around AI subsides, companies should put a heightened focus on practical applications that empower employees in their daily jobs. These applications can create competitive moats and generate measurable ROI. Across industries, functions, and geographies, companies that invest strategically can go beyond using AI to drive incremental value and instead create transformative change. Chapter 5 looks at what is required for leaders to set their teams up for success with AI. The challenge of AI in the workplace is not a technology challenge. It is a business challenge that calls upon leaders to align teams, address AI headwinds, and rewire their companies for change. Chapter 1 An innovation as powerful as the steam engine Imagine a world where machines not only perform physical labor but also think, learn, and make autonomous decisions. This world includes humans in the loop, bringing people and machines together in a state of superagency that increases personal productivity and creativity (see sidebar “AI superagency”). This is the transformative potential of AI, a technology with a potential impact poised to surpass even the biggest innovations of the past, from the printing press to the automobile. AI does not just automate tasks but goes further by automating cognitive functions. Unlike any invention before, AI-powered software can adapt, plan, guide—and even make—decisions. That’s why AI can be a catalyst for unprecedented economic growth and societal change in virtually every aspect of life. It will reshape our interaction with technology and with one another. Scientific discoveries and technological innovations are stones in the cathedral of human progress. Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and Inflection AI, partner at Greylock Partners, and author Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone. AI superagency What impact will AI have on humanity? Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato’s book Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future (Authors Equity, January 2025) explores this question. The book highlights how AI could enhance human agency and heighten our potential. It envisions a human-led, future-forward approach to AI. Superagency, a term coined by Hoffman, describes a state where individuals, empowered by AI, supercharge their creativity, productivity, and positive impact. Even those not directly engaging with AI can benefit from its broader effects on knowledge, efficiency, and innovation. AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. Over the past two years, AI has advanced in leaps and bounds, and enterprise-level adoption has accelerated due to lower costs and greater access to capabilities. Many notable AI innovations have emerged (Exhibit 1). For example, we have seen a rapid expansion of context windows, or the short-term memory of LLMs. The larger a context window , the more information an LLM can process at once. To illustrate, Google’s Gemini 1.5 could process one million tokens in February 2024, while its Gemini 1.5 Pro could process two million tokens by June of that same year. 4 The Keyword , “Our next-generation model: Gemini 1.5,” blog entry by Sundar Pichai and Demis Hassabis, Google, February 15, 2024; Google for Developers , “Gemini 1.5 Pro 2M context window, code execution capabilities, and Gemma 2 are available today,” blog entry by Logan Kilpatrick, Shrestha Basu Mallick, and Ronen Kofman, June 27, 2024. Overall, we see five big innovations for business that are driving the next wave of impact: enhanced intelligence and reasoning capabilities, agentic AI, multimodality, improved hardware innovation and computational power, and increased transparency. Image description begins: The text-based exhibit illustrates the evolution of capabilities of several gen AI large language models, or LLMs, from select frontier labs between 2022 and 2025. The is presented as a table comparing two time periods: 2022-2023 and January 2025. For each of five LLMs&mdash;Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, Microsoft's Phi, and OpenAI's GPT&mdash;the exhibit shows a list of capabilities for each time period. In 2022-2023, all five platforms lacked multimodal capabilities, functioning primarily with text only. Anthropic's Claude, for example, showed limited contextual understanding and no tool usage. Google's Gemini, similarly, had limited real-time data integration and low personalization. Meta's Llama 1 exhibited fair reasoning but had difficulty with complex conversations and lacked API access. Microsoft's Phi-1 had fair reasoning limited to coding tasks, with focused training on a smaller dataset. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 demonstrated fair reasoning, scoring well on the SAT but poorly on the bar examination, while also displaying limited contextual understanding in complex conversations, though it did offer standard API access for text generation. By January 2025, a significant shift is apparent. Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Llama 3.3, Phi-4, and OpenAI's model o1 all gained multimodal capabilities, incorporating text, audio, and images. Advanced reasoning capabilities, capable of multistep problem-solving and nuanced analysis, became common across most of the platforms. Enhanced contextual understanding, maintaining coherence during long dialogues, is also highlighted as an improvement. Furthermore, real-time data integration and advanced personalization features were added to some platforms. Finally, several platforms highlight improved or advanced API access, allowing for tools related to model and agent development and multimodal inputs. Source: Company websites and press releases.

One indicator is the performance of LLMs on standardized tests. OpenAI’s Chat GPT-3.5, introduced in 2022, demonstrated strong performance on high-school-level exams (for example, scoring in the 70th percentile on the SAT math and the 87th percentile on the SAT verbal sections). However, it often struggled with broader reasoning. Today’s models are near the intelligence level of people who hold advanced degrees. GPT-4 can so easily pass the Uniform Bar Examination that it would rank in the top 10 percent of test takers, 5 GPT-4 technical report, OpenAI, March 27, 2023. and it can answer 90 percent of questions correctly on the US Medical Licensing Examination. 6 Dana Brin, Vera Sorin, Akhil Vaid, et al., “Comparing ChatGPT and GPT-4 performance in USMLE soft skill assessments,” Scientific Reports , October 1, 2023. The advent of reasoning capabilities represents the next big leap forward for AI. Reasoning enhances AI’s capacity for complex decision making, allowing models to move beyond basic comprehension to nuanced understanding and the ability to create step-by-step plans to achieve goals. For businesses, this means they can fine-tune reasoning models and integrate them with domain-specific knowledge to deliver actionable insights with greater accuracy. Models such as OpenAI’s o1 or Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Mode are capable of reasoning in their responses, which gives users a human-like thought partner for their interactions, not just an information retrieval and synthesis engine. 7 “Learning to reason with LLMs,” OpenAI, September 12, 2024; “Gemini 2.09 Flash Thinking Mode,” Google, January 21, 2025. AI in Action: An interactive learning journey Explore the Superagency learning experience Agentic AI is acting autonomously I’ve always thought of AI as the most profound technology humanity is working on . . . more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we’ve done in the past. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet The ability to reason is growing more and more, allowing models to autonomously take actions and complete complex tasks across workflows. This is a profound step forward. As an example, in 2023, an AI bot could support call center representatives by synthesizing and summarizing large volumes of data—including voice messages, text, and technical specifications—to suggest responses to customer queries. In 2025, an AI agent can converse with a customer and plan the actions it will take afterward—for example, processing a payment, checking for fraud, and completing a shipping action. Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns. 8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes. 9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” Time , November 25, 2024. Multimodality is bringing together text, audio, and video Today’s AI models are evolving toward more advanced and diverse data processing capabilities across text, audio, and video. Over the last two years, we have seen improvements in the quality of each modality. For example, Google’s Gemini Live has improved audio quality and latency and can now deliver a human-like conversation with emotional nuance and expressiveness. 10 Ivan Solovyev and Shrestha Basu Mallick, “Gemini 2.0: Level up your apps with real-time multimodal interactions,” Google, December 23, 2024. Also, demonstrations of Sora by OpenAI show its ability to translate text to video. 11 “OpenAI releases AI video generator Sora but limits how it depicts people,” Associated Press, December 10, 2024. Hardware innovation is enhancing performance Hardware innovation and the resulting increase in compute power continue to enhance AI performance. Specialized chips allow faster, larger, and more versatile models. Enterprises can now adopt AI solutions that require high processing power, enabling real-time applications and opportunities for scalability. For example, an e-commerce company could significantly improve customer service by implementing AI-driven chatbots that leverage advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs). Using distributed cloud computing, the company could ensure optimal performance during peak traffic periods. Integrating edge hardware, the company could deploy models that analyze photos of damaged products to more accurately process insurance claims. Transparency is increasing AI, like most transformative technologies, grows gradually, then arrives suddenly. Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and Inflection AI, partner at Greylock Partners, and author AI is gradually becoming less risky, but it still lacks greater transparency and explainability. Both are critical for improving AI safety and reducing the potential for bias, which are imperative for widescale enterprise deployment. There is still a long way to go, but new models and iterations are rapidly improving. Stanford University’s Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) reports significant advances in model performance. Its Transparency Index, which uses a scale of 1 to 100, shows that Anthropic’s transparency score increased by 15 points to 51 and Amazon’s more than tripled to 41 between October 2023 and May 2024. 12 “The Foundation Model Transparency Index,” Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models, May 2024. Beyond LLMs, other forms of AI and machine learning (ML) are improving explainability, allowing the outputs of models that support consequential decisions (for example, credit risk assessment) to be traced back to the data that informed them. In this way, critical systems can be tested and monitored on a near-constant basis for bias and other everyday harms that arise from model drift and shifting data inputs, which happens even in systems that were well calibrated before deployment. All of this is crucial for detecting errors and ensuring compliance with regulations and company policies. Companies have improved explainability practices and built necessary checks and balances, but they must be prepared to evolve continuously to keep up with growing model capabilities. Achieving AI superagency in the workplace is not simply about mastering technology. It is every bit as much about supporting people, creating processes, and managing governance. The next chapters explore the nontechnological factors that will help shape the deployment of AI in the workplace. Chapter 2 Employees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up Employees will be the ones to make their organizations AI powerhouses. They are more ready to embrace AI in the workplace than business leaders imagine. They are more familiar with AI tools, they want more support and training, and they are more likely to believe AI will replace at least a third of their work in the near future. Now it’s imperative that leaders step up. They have more permission space than they realize, so it’s on them to be bold and capture the value of AI. Now. People are using [AI] to create amazing things. If we could see what each of us can do 10 or 20 years in the future, it would astonish us today. Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI Beyond the tipping point In our survey, nearly all employees (94 percent) and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). The good news is that our survey suggests three ways companies can accelerate AI adoption and move toward AI maturity. Image description begins: The exhibit shows the anticipated timeline for US employees' and business leaders&rsquo; use of gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily work tasks, presented as two stacked bar charts, one for C-suite respondents and one for employees. The segments are broken down into five categories representing different timeframes: Already using, less than a year, 1-5 years, over 5 years, and don't anticipate it. A final category, not sure, is also included. A key finding highlighted in the chart is that employees are three times more likely to be using gen AI today than their leaders expect (4 percent of C-suite respondents estimate that employees are currently using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks, while 13 percent of employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the C-suite, 16 percent expect employees to start using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within less than a year, 56 percent anticipate such adoption within 1-5 years, 11 percent expect it in over 5 years, and 10 percent don't anticipate employees will ever use gen AI for 30 percent of their work tasks. 3 percent of C-suite respondents are unsure. 34 percent of employees expect to use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their work tasks in less than a year, 37 percent within 1-5 years, 5 percent in over 5 years, and 7 percent don't anticipate ever using it in this way. 4 percent of employees are unsure.

Image description ends. Leaders can invest more in their employees Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees Our research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in Superagency . We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI to be quickly deployed with few guardrails; and just 4 percent identify as Doomers, who have a fundamentally negative view of AI (exhibit). Even those with a skeptical take on AI are familiar with it; 94 percent of Gloomers and 71 percent of Doomers say they have some familiarity with gen AI tools. Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of Gloomers and about half of Doomers say they are comfortable using gen AI at work. Image descriptions begins: The exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer. Each archetype's perspective is presented through a series of semicircular sunray charts showing the share of respondents within each group holding specific views. For example, two of the sunrays represent two separate sentiments, &ldquo;has extensive familiarity with gen AI&rdquo; and &ldquo;has at least some familiarity with gen AI.&rdquo; The Doomer archetype shows 16 percent with extensive familiarity and 71 percent with at least some familiarity. The Gloomer archetype demonstrates significantly higher percentages: 42 percent with extensive familiarity and 94 percent with at least some. The Bloomer archetype shows 55 percent with extensive familiarity and 96 percent with at least some, and the Zoomer archetype shows 67 percent with extensive familiarity and 96 percent with at least some. The exhibit further illustrates employees&rsquo; comfort levels with using gen AI results, belief in the net benefits of gen AI within the next five years, and plans to utilize gen AI more in their personal lives. In the Doomer archetype, 47 percent say they are comfortable using gen AI results, 54 percent believe in gen AI&rsquo;s net benefit within the next five years, and 49 percent plan increased personal use of gen AI. The Gloomer archetype shows markedly higher percentages in these three areas: 79 percent, 82 percent, and 77 percent respectively. The Bloomer and Zoomer archetypes present even higher percentages across these three metrics; for instance, 91 percent of Zoomers are comfortable using gen AI results, 87 percent believe in gen AI&rsquo;s net benefit within five years, and 85 percent plan to increase their personal use of gen AI. Finally, the exhibit the includes a separate section depicting the share of respondents within each archetype, indicating the size of each group with a series of donut charts. The Doomer group comprises 4 percent of employees, Gloomers are 37 percent, Bloomers are 39 percent, and Zoomers are 20 percent. Source: McKinsey US employee survey, Oct&ndash;Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends. As noted at the beginning of this chapter, employees anticipate AI will have a dramatic impact on their work. Now they would like their companies to invest in the training that will help them succeed. Nearly half of employees in our survey say they want more formal training and believe it is the best way to boost AI adoption. They also would like access to AI tools in the form of betas or pilots, and they indicate that incentives such as financial rewards and recognition can improve uptake. Yet employees are not getting the training and support they need. More than a fifth report that they have received minimal to no support (Exhibit 3). Outside the United States, employees also want more training (see sidebar “Global perspectives on training”). Image description begins: The first section of the exhibit is a horizontal bar chart showing the percentage of US employees who believe that specific company initiatives would increase their daily use of gen AI tools. Formal gen AI training from their organization scored highest at 48 percent, followed by seamless integration into existing workflows (45 percent), access to gen AI tools (41 percent), and incentives and rewards (40 percent). Lower percentages were observed for usage of gen AI being a requirement for a certification program (30 percent), explicit instructions from managers to use gen AI (30 percent), being involved in the development of the tools (29 percent), and OKRs/KPIs tied to gen AI usage (22 percent). The second section is a stacked pair of segmented bar charts illustrating the perceived level of support for gen AI capability building at their organizations, comparing current vs in three years. This chart shows the distribution of responses across four levels of support: not needed, none/minimal, moderate to significant, and fully supported. Currently, 6 percent of employees report that support for gen AI in their organizations is not needed, 22 percent report they receive none/minimal support, 44 percent report moderate to significant support, and 29 percent report they are fully supported. Looking ahead to three years in the future, these percentages are projected to shift considerably: gen AI support not needed drops to 4 percent, none/minimal support for gen AI usage decreases to 10 percent, moderate to significant support for gen AI usage increases to 56 percent, and fully supported increases to 31 percent.

Sidebar Global perspectives on training To get a clearer picture of global AI adoption trends, we looked at trends across five countries: Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Broadly speaking, these employees and C-suite leaders—the “international” group in this report—have similar views of AI as their US peers. In some key areas, however, including the topic of training, their experiences differ. Many international employees are concerned about insufficient training, even though they report receiving far more support than US employees. Some 84 percent of international employees say they receive significant or full organizational support to learn AI skills, versus just over half of US employees. International employees also have more opportunities to participate in developing gen AI tools at work than their US counterparts, with differences of at least ten percentage points in activities such as providing feedback, beta testing, and requesting specific features (exhibit). C-suite leaders can help millennials lead the way Many millennials aged 35 to 44 are managers and team leaders in their companies. In our survey, they self-report having the most experience and enthusiasm about AI, making them natural champions of transformational change. Millennials are the most active generation of AI users. Some 62 percent of 35- to 44-year-old employees report high levels of expertise with AI, compared with 50 percent of 18- to 24-year-old Gen Zers and 22 percent of baby boomers over 65 (Exhibit 4). By tapping into that enthusiasm and expertise, leaders can help millennials play a crucial role in AI adoption. Image description begins: The exhibit is a grid of proportional area charts displaying US employee sentiment toward gen AI by age group. Each row represents a different sentiment, from top to bottom: has extensive familiarity with gen AI, is comfortable using gen AI at work, provides feedback on gen AI tools, and wants to participate in the design of gen AI tools. The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each sentiment within each age group. The chart reveals that the 35-44 age group exhibits the most positive sentiment across most categories. For example, 90 percent of this group reports being comfortable using gen AI at work, the highest percentage among all age groups for this metric. This group also shows the highest percentage (62 percent) reporting extensive familiarity with gen AI. In contrast, the 55-64 and 65+ age groups consistently show lower percentages across all four metrics, with only 26 percent and 22 percent of employees in these age groups reporting extensive familiarity with gen AI respectively. The 18-24, 25-34, and 45-54 age groups show intermediate levels of positive sentiment, generally lower than the 35-44 group but higher than the 55-64 and 65+ age groups.

Since many millennials are managers, they can support their teams to become more adept AI users. This helps push their companies toward AI maturity. Two-thirds of managers say they field questions from their team about how to use AI tools at least once a week, and a similar percentage say they recommend AI tools to their teams to solve problems (Exhibit 5). Image description begins: The exhibit examines US manager respondents and their experiences with gen AI tools. The exhibit is composed of two main sections. The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. The second section explores the use of gen AI tools to resolve team member challenges. This section uses two donut charts, each showing percentages of respondents. The first donut chart indicates that 68 percent of managers report recommending a gen AI tool to solve a team member's challenge in the past month. The second donut chart shows that 86 percent of managers who recommended a gen AI tool report that the tool was successful in resolving the team member&rsquo;s challenge.

Since leaders have the permission space, they can be bolder In many transformations, employees are not ready for change, but AI is different. Employee readiness and familiarity are high, which gives business leaders the permission space to act. Leaders can listen to employees describe how they are using AI today and how they envision their work being transformed. They also can provide employees with much-needed training and empower managers to move AI use cases from pilot to scale. It’s critical that leaders meet this moment. It’s the only way to accelerate the probability that their companies will reach AI maturity. But they must move with alacrity, or they will fall behind. Chapter 3 Delivering speed and safety AI technology is advancing at record speed. ChatGPT was released about two years ago; OpenAI reports that usage now exceeds 300 million weekly users 13 Hayden Field, “OpenAI’s active user count soars to 300 million people per week,” CNBC, December 4, 2024. and that over 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies employ its technology. 14 Krystal Hu and Dawn Chmielewski, “OpenAI&#x27;s Altman pitches ChatGPT Enterprise to large firms, including some Microsoft customers,” Reuters, April 12, 2024. The internet did not reach this level of usage until the early 2000s, nearly a decade after its inception. Soon after the first automobiles were on the road, there was the first car crash. But we didn’t ban cars—we adopted speed limits, safety standards, licensing requirements, drunk-driving laws, and other rules of the road. Bill Gates, cofounder of Microsoft The majority of employees describe themselves as AI optimists; Zoomers and Bloomers make up 59 percent of the workplace. Even Gloomers, who are one of the two less-optimistic segments in our analysis, report high levels of gen AI familiarity, with over a quarter saying they plan to use AI more next year. Business leaders need to embrace this speed and optimism to ensure that their companies don’t get left behind. Yet despite all the excitement and early experimentation, 47 percent of C-suite leaders say their organizations are developing and releasing gen AI tools too slowly, citing talent skill gaps as a key reason for the delay (Exhibit 6). Image description begins: The exhibit shows US C-suite executive sentiment toward the pace of development and release of gen AI tools within their organizations, in the form of two segmented bar charts. The first bar chart presents the overall perception of the pace, where 47 percent of respondents find the pace to be too slow, while 45 percent feel it is about right, and a smaller 9 percent consider it too fast. The second bar chart delves into the top reasons behind the perceived slow pace of gen AI tool development and release in executives&rsquo; organizations, focusing on the responses from those who indicated that development was too slow. The most prominent reason cited is talent skill gaps, accounting for 46 percent of these responses. Resourcing constraints followed closely, with 38 percent of respondents identifying this as a key factor. Complex approval process and technical complexity each receive 8 percent of the responses.

Business leaders are trying to meet the need for speed by increasing investments in AI. Of the executives surveyed, 92 percent say they expect to boost spending on AI in the next three years, with 55 percent expecting investments to increase by at least 10 percent from current levels. But they can no longer just spend on AI without expecting results. As companies move on from the initial thrill of gen AI, business leaders face increasing pressure to generate ROI from their gen AI deployments. We are at a turning point. The initial AI excitement may be waning, but the technology is accelerating. Bold and purposeful strategies are needed to set the stage for future success. Leaders are taking the first step: One quarter of those executives we surveyed have defined a gen AI road map, while just over half have a draft that is being refined (Exhibit 7). With technology changing this fast, all road maps and plans will evolve constantly. For leaders, the key is to make some clear choices about what valuable opportunities they choose to pursue first—and how they will work together with peers, teams, and partners to deliver that value. Image description begins: The exhibit is comprised of two horizontal segmented bar charts. The first chart displays the share of US C-suite respondents who have a defined gen AI roadmap. 21 percent report not currently having a roadmap but one was in progress, 53 percent indicate having a roadmap that is still being refined, and 25 percent state that a comprehensive roadmap is already in place. The second bar chart illustrates the level to which US C-suite respondents have identified revenue-generating use cases for gen AI. 1 percent of respondents indicate they have not yet identified any such use cases, while 10 percent report they have minimally identified, 38 percent have partially identified, 39 percent have mostly identified, and 12 percent have fully identified such use cases.

Image description ends The dilemma of speed versus safety There’s a spanner in the works: Regulation and safety often continue to be seen as insurmountable challenges rather than opportunities. Leaders want to increase AI investments and accelerate development, but they wrestle with how to make AI safe in the workplace. Data security, hallucinations, biased outputs, and misuse (for example, creating harmful content or enabling fraud) are challenges that cannot be ignored. Employees are well aware of AI’s safety challenges. Their top concerns are cybersecurity, privacy, and accuracy (Exhibit 8). But what will it take for leaders to address these concerns while also moving ahead at light speed? Image description begins: The exhibit shows the share of US employees with concerns regarding gen AI, through a series of proportional area charts, each representing a specific risk associated with gen AI. The size of each chart indicates the percentage of US employees who cite that risk as a concern. Cybersecurity risks are cited by 51 percent of respondents, inaccuracies by 50 percent, and concerns about personal privacy by 43 percent. Intellectual property infringement is a concern for 40 percent of respondents, followed by workforce displacement (35 percent), explainability (34 percent), and equity and fairness (30 percent). Less prominent but still significant concerns were regulatory compliance issues (28 percent), national security (24 percent), damage to organizational reputation (16 percent), environmental impact (15 percent), physical safety (14 percent), and political stability (13 percent).

Employees trust business leaders to get it right While employees acknowledge the risks and even the likelihood that AI may replace a considerable portion of their work, they place high trust in their own employers to deploy AI safely and ethically. Notably, 71 percent of employees trust their employers to act ethically as they develop AI. In fact, they trust their employers more than universities, large technology companies, and tech start-ups (Exhibit 9). Image description begins: The exhibit depicts the share of US employees who highly trust different institutions to deploy gen AI tools responsibly, safely, and ethically. The data is presented as four separate unit charts, each representing a distinct institution: employer, universities, large tech companies, and start-ups. Each unit chart consists of a 10x10 matrix of squares. The number of light blue squares within each grid represents the percentage of employees who express high trust in each institution. The remaining squares are light gray. Employers receive the highest level of trust (71 percent), followed by universities (67 percent), large tech companies (61 percent), and start-ups (51 percent). Source: McKinsey US employee survey, Oct&ndash;Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends. According to our research, this is in line with a broader trend in which employees show higher trust in their employers to do the right thing in general (73 percent) than in other institutions, including the government (45 percent). This trust should help leaders act with confidence as they tackle the speed-versus-safety dilemma. That confidence also applies outside the United States, even though employees in other regions may have more desire for regulation (see sidebar “Global perspectives on regulation”). Sidebar Global perspectives on regulation A high percentage of international C-suite leaders we surveyed across five regions (Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) are Gloomers, who favor greater regulatory oversight. Between 37 to 50 percent of international C-suite leaders self-identify as Gloomers, versus 31 percent in the United States. This may be because top-down regulation is more accepted in many countries outside the United States. Of the global C-suite leaders surveyed, half or more worry that ethical use and data privacy issues are holding back their employees from adopting gen AI. However, our research shows that attitudes about regulation are not inhibiting the economic expectations of business leaders outside the United States. More than half of the international executives (versus 41 percent of US executives) indicate they want their companies to be among the first adopters of AI, with those in India and Singapore being especially bullish (exhibit). The desire of international business leaders to be AI first movers can be explained by the revenue they expect from their AI deployments. Some 31 percent of international C-suite leaders say they expect AI to deliver a revenue uplift of more than 10 percent in the next three years, versus just 17 percent of US leaders. Indian executives are the most optimistic, with 55 percent expecting a revenue uplift of 10 percent or more over the next three years. Risk management for gen AI In Superagency , Hoffman argues that new risks naturally accompany new capabilities—meaning they should be managed but not necessarily eliminated. 15 Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato, Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future , Authors Equity, January 28, 2025. Leaders need to contend with external threats, such as infringement on intellectual property (IP), AI-enabled malware, and internal threats that arise from the AI adoption process. The first step in building fit-for-purpose risk management is to launch a comprehensive assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities in each of a company’s businesses. Leaders can then establish a robust governance structure, implement real-time monitoring and control mechanisms, and ensure continuous training and adherence to regulatory requirements. One powerful control mechanism is respected third-party benchmarking that can increase AI safety and trust. Examples include Stanford CRFM’s Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) initiative—which offers comprehensive benchmarks to assess the fairness, accountability, transparency, and broader societal impact of a company’s AI systems—as well as MLCommons’s AILuminate tool kit on which researchers from Stanford collaborated. 16 “MLCommons launches AILuminate, first-of-its-kind benchmark to measure the safety of large language models,” Business Wire, press release, December 04, 2024. Other organizations such as the Data &amp; Trust Alliance unite large companies to create cross-industry metadata standards that aim to bring more transparency to enterprise AI models. While benchmarks have significant potential to build trust, our survey shows that only 39 percent of C-suite leaders use them to evaluate their AI systems. Furthermore, when leaders do use benchmarks, they opt to measure operational metrics (for example, scalability, reliability, robustness, and cost efficiency) and performance-related metrics (including accuracy, precision, F1 score, latency, and throughput). These benchmarking efforts tend to be less focused on ethical and compliance concerns: Only 17 percent of C-suite leaders who benchmark say it’s most important to measure fairness, bias, transparency, privacy, and regulatory issues (Exhibit 10). Image description begins: The exhibit presents data on the utilization of benchmarks for gen AI tools among US C-suite executives. The exhibit is in two parts. The first part is a pie chart showing that 39 percent of respondents have benchmark standards for gen AI tools used by their employees. This indicates a significant minority of C-suite executives currently employ such standards. The second part of the exhibit is a horizontal bar chart displaying the benchmarks considered most important by the C-suite respondents. Performance-related benchmarks are deemed most important by 41 percent of respondents. Operational benchmarks follow closely behind, cited by 35 percent of participants. Ethical and compliance benchmarks are a lower priority, selected by 17 percent of the respondents, while other benchmarks account for only 7 percent of responses. This reveals a noteworthy disparity, suggesting C-suite leaders put a stronger emphasis on benchmarking the performance and operational aspects of AI rather than benchmarking ethical considerations. Source: McKinsey US CxO survey, Oct-Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends. The focus on operational and performance metrics reflects the understandable desire to prioritize immediate technical and business outcomes. But ignoring ethical considerations can come back to haunt leaders. When employees don’t trust AI systems, they are less likely to accept them. Although benchmarks are not a panacea to eliminate all risk and can’t ensure that AI systems are fully efficient, ethical, and safe, they are a useful tool. Even companies that excel at all three categories of AI readiness—technology, employees, and safety—are not necessarily scaling or delivering the value expected. Nevertheless, leaders can harness the power of big ambitions to transform their companies with AI. The next chapter examines how. Chapter 4 Embracing bigger ambitions Most organizations that have invested in AI are not getting the returns they had hoped. They are not winning the full economic potential of AI. About half of C-suite leaders at companies that have deployed AI describe their initiatives as still developing or expanding (Exhibit 11). They have had the time to move further. Our research shows that more than two-thirds of leaders launched their first gen AI use cases over a year ago. This is a time when you should be getting benefits [from AI] and hope that your competitors are just playing around and experimenting. Erik Brynjolfsson, professor at Stanford University and director of the Digital Economy Lab at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) Image description begins: The exhibit is a horizontally stacked bar graph that shows the percentage of C-suite respondents who describe their gen AI rollouts by maturity stages. 8 percent of respondents report their organizations are in the nascent stage, characterized by minimal gen AI initiatives with no significant impact on employee workflows. A significantly larger portion, 39 percent, describe their organizations as being in the emerging stage, where gen AI pilot projects are starting to show value. The developing stage, where gen AI implementation is changing certain workflows and increasing efficiency, accounts for 31 percent of respondents. 22 percent of respondents place their organizations in the expanding stage, indicating that gen AI is scaled across departments, transforming workflows, and enhancing operations. Finally, only 1 percent of C-suite respondents describe their gen AI rollouts as mature, meaning that gen AI is fundamentally changing how work is done and driving substantial business "

Most organizations see AI automation ROI between 150-500% over 2-5 years, depending on implementation scope and business size. Small businesses often achieve 200-500% ROI within 1-2 years with focused implementations, while enterprises typically see 200-500% ROI over 3-5 years with comprehensive programs. Quick wins can deliver measurable benefits within 3-6 months, but full value realization usually takes 12-24 months as systems learn and adoption increases. How do you calculate AI automation ROI beyond simple cost savings? Modern AI automation ROI calculation uses a comprehensive framework that includes direct financial benefits (cost reduction, revenue enhancement), operational improvements (efficiency gains, quality improvements), and strategic value (competitive advantage, innovation capability). The formula is: Comprehensive ROI = (Financial ROI × 40-60%) + (Operational ROI × 25-35%) + (Strategic ROI × 15-25%). This captures the full spectrum of value creation, including indirect benefits like improved customer satisfaction, employee productivity, and market positioning. What are the biggest factors that impact AI automation ROI success? The most critical success factors include strong leadership commitment and change management (accounting for 40-50% of success), proper technology selection and integration (25-30%), and comprehensive user adoption strategies (20-25%). Organizations that invest adequately in training, maintain realistic timelines, and focus on user experience typically achieve 2- 3x higher ROI than those that treat AI automation as purely a technology implementation. Which business processes typically deliver the highest AI automation ROI? High-ROI processes share common characteristics: high volume, rule-based decisions, significant manual effort, and clear success metrics. Top performers include customer service (40-70% efficiency gains), document processing (70-90% time reduction), fraud detection (60-80% false positive reduction), and inventory optimization (25-35% improvement). The key is starting with processes that have quantifiable inputs and outputs, making ROI measurement straightforward. How much should I budget for AI automation implementation? Budget allocation typically follows this framework: Technology investment (40-50%), Professional services and implementation (25-35%), Internal resources and training (15-25%), and Change management (10-15%), with 5-10% contingency. Small businesses might invest $ 1 K-$100 K with 1-6 month timelines, mid-market companies $ 100 K-$5 M over 6-18 months, and enterprises $ 5 M+ over 18-36 months. The key is matching investment level to organizational readiness and starting with pilot projects to prove value before scaling. These ROI frameworks and measurement strategies provide the foundation for making informed AI automation investment decisions and maximizing business value.

        "content": "Share Share Indeed Hiring Lab AI at Work Report 2025 AI at Work Report 2025: How GenAI is Rewiring the DNA of Jobs The future of work and the role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is not a question of whether GenAI will change jobs, but what kinds of jobs will be most and least changed, why, and how. By Annina Hering &amp; Arcenis Rojas September 23, 2025 The Indeed GenAI Skill Transformation Index measures how much GenAI could change the way different skills or jobs are done. Instead of measuring if GenAI is capable of fully replacing a human worker, it examines how skills may be applied going forward and how human involvement with those skills and tasks may change. GenAI models evaluated both the cognitive and physical demands required across almost 2,900 work skills and GenAI’s capacity to perform them. Based on this evaluation, skills were grouped into four distinct categories based on their potential to be transformed by GenAI: Minimal transformation, assisted transformation, hybrid transformation, and full transformation. Download the Indeed Hiring Lab AI at Work Report 2025 here. Check out the Indeed Hiring Lab Labor Market Overview for Indeed Futureworks 2025 Key points: More than a quarter (26%) of jobs posted on Indeed in the past year could be “highly” transformed by GenAI. But the majority (54%) are likely to be “moderately” transformed, and their evolution will depend on how quickly businesses adopt GenAI, and how well workers adapt and reskill. Almost half (46%) of skills in a typical US job posting are poised for &#8220;hybrid transformation&#8221; by GenAI. Human oversight will remain critical when applying these skills, but GenAI can already perform a significant portion of routine work. Some occupations, including software development, are more highly exposed. Roles requiring more physical presence and human interaction, including nursing, are likely to be less impacted, with GenAI primarily changing administrative tasks but not necessarily the core parts of these jobs. Earlier versions of this analysis found that zero human work skills were “very likely” to be fully replaced by GenAI. Today, 19 skills (0.7% of all skills analyzed) were assessed to be “very likely” to be fully replaced by GenAI, still small in absolute terms, but a significant signal of progress. The future of work and the role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is not just about job loss or automation — it’s about transformation. Rather than thinking in either-or terms — jobs lost vs. jobs saved — we must understand GenAI’s impact along a continuum of transformation. The real question is not whether GenAI will change jobs — it absolutely is, and will. The question is what kinds of jobs will be most and least changed, why, and how. To quantify this shift, Hiring Lab developed Indeed’s GenAI Skill Transformation Index (GSTI) — a metric designed to estimate how substantially GenAI could transform a given skill or job, not by assessing replacement likelihood, but by evaluating the degree of potential transformation. Under this newly designed framework, we found that 41% of almost 2,900 common work skills assessed are exposed to the highest potential levels of GenAI-driven transformation, and roughly a quarter (26%) of all jobs on Indeed appear poised to radically transform in the future. Critically, these are only measures of potential transformation. Any realized impacts will depend entirely on whether and how businesses adopt and integrate GenAI tools — a process that often relies on a foundational level of digitalization that many firms have yet to achieve . It’s also important to note that the US labor market has been in a multi-year slowdown , which makes it difficult to identify changes attributable to GenAI from those driven by broader economic trends. Understanding the depth of change: The GenAI Skill Transformation Index (GSTI) Hiring Lab’s previous research developed a methodology to assess GenAI’s potential across four dimensions : the models’ ability to provide theoretical knowledge related to a given work skill, their ability to solve problems using a skill, the importance of physical presence in executing a skill, and overall likelihood that a GenAI model could fully replace a human in performing a skill. This year, we retained the methodological foundation of our earlier work but introduced two key refinements. First, we narrowed our focus to the two dimensions that most directly determine task transformation: Problem-solving ability — The degree to which a skill requires cognitive reasoning, applied knowledge, and practical judgment, and how well GenAI can replicate it. Physical necessity — Whether a skill requires physical execution and thus lies outside the current scope of GenAI. Until general-purpose robotics advances significantly, these tasks remain human-exclusive. Second, we moved from a single-model evaluation to a multi-model approach. Previously, we relied on assessments generated by one large language model — OpenAI’s flagship GPT model. This analysis tested multiple models to understand their consistency and relevance for our research use case. The results were clear: not all models perform equally. Some produced lower-quality outputs or highly volatile responses across multiple runs, and the models’ capabilities can and do vary significantly. For businesses seeking to more broadly implement GenAI into their workflows and products, choosing the right model for their specific processes and business cases will be critical in ensuring reliable insights. Ultimately, this analysis was based on the combined, consistent, high-quality results from OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 and Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4. We also introduced a systematic analysis of the &#8220;thinking&#8221; processes within each model’s evaluation, focusing on selected skill families and occupations. Reviewing not just the outputs but also the models’ own explanations of their capabilities and limitations helped us gain a deeper understanding of how GenAI is reshaping the DNA of jobs, showing not only which skills are most/least likely to be replaced by GenAI output, but also how the human performance of those skills could change. As in past years, we began with an Indeed-identified base of almost 2,900 individual work skills commonly found in US job postings, ranging from aviation to wound care. These 2,900 job-related skills were each rated on a 5-point scale on both the problem-solving and physical necessity dimensions. These evaluations were plotted into a 5&#215;5 matrix capturing the relationship between a skill’s cognitive and physical demands, and GenAI’s capacity to perform it. Based on this structure, we identified four distinct degrees of potential GenAI-driven skill transformation: Minimal transformation : Through some combination of elevated physical requirements and/or limited reasoning capability, human performance of these skills will likely remain largely unchanged. Skills that fall into this categorization include: patient care, employee relations, and network administration. Assisted transformation : These are skills where GenAI may offer limited or generic support (creating/providing templates, conducting basic research, or suggesting tools/methods), but where humans still need to practically apply the skill. Skills that fall into this categorization include: environmental law, trading, and teaching. Hybrid transformation : GenAI performs the bulk of routine work for these skills, but human oversight (though not necessarily direct execution) remains essential. GenAI can independently execute standard tasks using these skills with high reliability, but humans are still needed to manage exceptions, interpret ambiguous cases, validate outputs, and/or ensure ethical or legal compliance. Skills that fall into this categorization include: medical coding, travel planning, and proofreading. Full transformation : GenAI has the potential to use these skills independently to execute on typically well-structured tasks that could, under the right conditions, be automated end-to-end. However, the potential for full transformation doesn’t guarantee that the models will fully displace humans from these skills. Actual transformation depends on model capability, business readiness, and task context. Skills that fall into this categorization include: basic math, prompt engineering, and image classification. Table titled &#8220;The continuum of change: GenAI Skill Transformation (GSTI) categories&#8221; reveals the varying levels of GenAI influence by analyzing problem-solving ability and psychological necessity of over 2900 skills. Applying this framework to the ~2,900 skills extracted from US job postings, we found a clear distribution: 40% of skills fall into the minimal transformation category, 19% into assisted transformation, 40% into hybrid transformation, and 1% into full transformation. Notably, technology skills dominate the deeper transformation categories — 54% of skills that fall into the hybrid transformation category, and 57% of fully transformable skills, are technology skills. Bar chart titled &#8220;Most skills still out of reach for GenAI&#8221; shows the distribution of skills across varying GSTI levels. When our initial analysis was completed a year ago, no skills were rated as “very likely” to be fully replaced by GenAI. Today, 19 skills (0.7% of all skills analyzed) were assessed to be “very likely” to be fully replaced by GenAI, still small in absolute terms, but a significant signal of progress. GenAI has gotten (and continues to get) smarter. As long as physical execution is not required — an admittedly big caveat — and GenAI capabilities continue to grow, more skills are likely to cross the threshold into realistic automation as work continues to evolve. The hybrid horizon: Almost half of US job skills are ready for GenAI transformation Not all companies are at the same point in their AI journey. Some actively integrate GenAI tools and models into their workflows, while others are still early in their digital transformation, or have yet to begin. This critically important reality means that this analysis does not and largely cannot measure transformation itself, but only transformational potential — what could happen if GenAI were fully integrated into how work gets done. To explore this potential, we applied the GenAI Skill Transformation Index (GSTI) to skills found across the broad range of occupations represented by US job postings published on Indeed. For each occupation, we assessed the share of listed skills that fell into one of the four transformation categories (minimal, assisted, hybrid, full). On average, 46 percent of skills in a typical job posting fall into the categories of hybrid transformation or full transformation. In other words, under optimal conditions, GenAI could potentially profoundly reshape almost half the skills needed by a typical worker. Twelve percent of skills in the typical job fall into the assisted transformation category, suggesting areas where human effort will be supported — but not replaced — by GenAI. The remaining 42 percent of skills are expected to remain largely unaffected, at least for now, falling into the minimal transformation zone. However, the degree of potential transformation varies widely across occupations. For example, a large majority (81%) of skills mentioned in the typical software development job posting fall into the hybrid transformation classifications. By contrast, two-thirds (68%) of listed skills in the typical nursing job posting fall into the minimal transformation category. By analyzing the core skills within these occupations and their relative exposure to GenAI, we can gain insight into those skills and tasks expected to remain more person-forward vs. those which may be taken over by GenAI, and, ultimately, how jobs may change going forward. Graph titled &#8220;Almost half of skills in the typical US job are poised for deep transformation&#8221; shows the share of skills in US job postings by their transformation level based on GSTI (minimal, assisted, hybrid, and full transformation). Nursing in the GenAI era: Shielded at the core, shifting at the edges The core of the nursing profession — including skills from the patient care, patient care settings &amp; specialization, and caregiving skill families — requires physical presence, emotional intelligence, and real-time human decision-making. These areas fall firmly within the category of ‘minimal transformation.’ As one of the model’s thinking processes put it: “ &#8230;the core of patient care is inherently physical and interpersonal. ” However, GenAI is poised to have a larger impact on some peripheral/non-core nursing skills. Communication skills are mentioned as requirements in almost a quarter (23%) of nursing job postings, and are classified as hybrid transformation in our evaluation. For example, GenAI systems already support real-time translation, which is particularly valuable in multilingual care settings. General administrative (14%) and specific healthcare administrative-related skills (9%) are also further along the automation curve. In these areas, GenAI demonstrates strong capabilities in information retrieval, documentation, text processing, and analysis — functions that currently consume a significant share of caregivers’ time. Drawing directly from our research results, GenAI’s own “thinking” reveals its strengths in these domains. For medical coding, for example, the model explains: “ The model can access extensive information about coding systems, rules, and best practices, and can assist with code lookup, documentation review, and error checking. ” In nursing administration, GenAI describes its role as providing “ theoretical knowledge, policy templates, compliance guidelines, and advice on best practices. ” This split between core and peripheral skills is critical. GenAI does not replace nurses, but has the potential to redistribute cognitive and administrative load, freeing time for patient-facing care. As aging populations drive rising demand and nursing shortages persist, this time-saving effect becomes not just beneficial but necessary. From a labor market and employer standpoint, the objective among healthcare employers likely won’t be to reduce staff, but instead to deploy GenAI where it improves task allocation. Scatterplot titled &#8220;Nursing occupations: Peripheral skills have potential for hybrid transformation&#8221; shows the occupation-level share of US job postings (nursing) mentioning top 10 GSTI skill families. GenAI is reshaping software development teams — and potentially shrinking them At the other end of the spectrum, software development stands at the epicenter of potential GenAI-driven workforce transformation, in large part because technical skills (unlike care skills) are among those most exposed to GenAI models’ growing capabilities. Skills including IT &amp; software programming skills (mentioned in 82% of software development job postings) or programming languages and frameworks (59%) are classified as hybrid transformation skills. In practical terms, GenAI is taking over routine, repeatable, and information-based aspects of coding. As one model’s thinking process puts it: “ The model can support this skill by providing explanations, code samples, debugging help, and architectural advice. ” This could mean that as GenAI takes over routine coding tasks, human developers will shift from “doing the work” to “directing the work”— overseeing AI outputs, solving edge cases, and ensuring quality control. In 9 out of the top 10 skill families most commonly found in software development jobs, GenAI can now potentially lead the process while humans validate, refine, and contextualize outputs. Even so, there are limitations in this hybrid environment where humans and machines work hand-in-hand. As one of the models’ thinking processes told us: “ Successful implementation requires significant human interaction, facilitation skills, organizational change management, and the ability to adapt to unique organizational contexts and politics. ” Scatterplot titled &#8220;Software development occupations: Hybrid transformation dominates 9 out of the top 10 skill families&#8221; shows the occupation-level share of US job postings (software development) mentioning top 10 GSTI skill families. This new way of working should be expected to bring noticeable gains in speed and efficiency. However, it also raises unavoidable questions about the future size and shape of software development teams. The reality is that GenAI’s productivity lift virtually guarantees that fewer people will be needed to achieve the same results — though more workers may be needed if output is expected to increase, not just stay the same. The early-career software development pipeline — already under pressure — will need to be reimagined in order to cultivate the higher-level critical thinking and AI-oversight skills that GenAI cannot replicate. The middle majority: Half of all jobs poised for moderate transformation Job postings represent the shape of work as it is evolving, not just as it exists today, and Indeed data allow us to see in real time how demand is shifting for various roles. Occupations most exposed to significant GenAI transformation — those with the highest combined share of skills in the hybrid transformation and full transformation classifications — accounted for about 26% all job postings on Indeed over the past year. On the other end of the spectrum, the occupations with the lowest exposure to significant transformation — and the highest share of skills classified as minimal and assisted transformation — make up 20% of all job postings. That leaves 54% of job postings that fall into the moderate transformation category. These jobs may not be radically redefined overnight, but are positioned to evolve meaningfully under the right conditions as GenAI adoption rises. What makes this middle segment so important is its potential to tip in either direction. Unlike high- or low-exposure roles, where the trajectory is relatively straightforward, moderate-exposure jobs are more sensitive to decisions made by employers, policymakers, and technology providers. Whether these roles shift toward greater automation or remain primarily human-led will depend on how organizations adopt GenAI tools, how quickly workers are reskilled, and how job design evolves. These jobs are not niche — they are mainstream. Their share of total postings means that what happens in this segment will shape the experience of GenAI in the workplace for a large portion of the labor force. And because the transformation potential is not fixed but context-dependent, they also offer the greatest opportunity for strategic action. Bar chart titled &#8220;A quarter of US jobs are highly exposed to GenAI transformation&#8221; shows the share of US job postings and their GenAI transformation potential (low, moderate, high). Conclusion It’s tempting to think that as GenAI improves, more skills will simply migrate into the “fully transformable” zone. But the overall picture of GenAI is more complex. Our analysis shows that only 1% of skills fall into the “fully transformable” category today, and even those tend to be sub-skills within larger workflows, like parsing XML, classifying text, or performing basic calculations. On their own, these skills may be automatable. But in practice, they exist within broader systems that demand human judgment, contextual understanding, and quality control. This is where the distinction between assisted transformation and hybrid transformation becomes critical. In assisted transformation, the human remains the lead actor, with GenAI offering support. In hybrid transformation, GenAI handles the bulk of execution, but the human oversees, evaluates, and intervenes when needed. Importantly, work skills themselves won’t change, but how they are applied almost certainly will. Less hands-on coding, for instance, but a greater need for humans who can manage complexity, steer the system, and solve the edge cases GenAI can’t. This shift helps to raise the bar, not lower it. To oversee GenAI effectively, workers will very likely need to be able to outperform it in reasoning, domain expertise, and context. Full transformation, then, remains more of a theoretical ceiling than the current norm. Our research shows that not all large language models are equally capable (or equally suitable) for every task. Performance varies by provider and use case, and choosing the right model is as much a strategic decision as a technical or even budgetary one. Infrastructure, process readiness, and risk appetite will all shape how far and fast companies can go. What we are witnessing now is not a temporary phase; it’s the structural shift that underpins how GenAI is beginning to rewire the DNA of jobs. Hybrid transformation is not a bridge to full transformation — it is, for many roles, the destination. Methodology This analysis is based on Indeed’s skill database, which includes 2,884 distinct skills commonly found in US job postings and a definition of those skills. We evaluated how GenAI may transform humans&#8217; performance of these skills using generative artificial intelligence itself. GenAI’s capability was assessed along three core dimensions: its ability to offer theoretical knowledge about the skill, its ability to apply that skill in problem-solving, and the significance of physical presence in effectively carrying out the skill. Each of these dimensions was rated on a 5-point scale, where a score of 1 represented minimal or no capability in that dimension, and a score of 5 signified high proficiency. These scores were then considered by the model in an ultimate determination of the overall likelihood that GenAI could replace human involvement across any of the ~2,900 individual skills, using a similar 5-point rating system. The results from the problem-solving ability and physical necessity ratings form the foundation of the GenAI Skill Transformation Index (GSTI) — our classification system that assigns each skill to one of four transformation categories: minimal transformation, assisted transformation, hybrid transformation, or full transformation. These categories were designed to capture the nature and depth of GenAI’s potential impact, from limited influence to full task automation. Unlike previous years, which relied on a single model, our 2025 evaluation adopts a multi-model approach to improve robustness and reflect variance in LLM capabilities. We tested several leading models and observed substantial variation in output quality and consistency. Some models produced unstable or overly confident results across repeated runs. To ensure reliability, we selected the two best-performing models: GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, version 2025-04-14) and Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic, 2025). Each model independently rated all 2,884 skills 15 times, using a temperature of 0 for determinism. We consolidated these runs by taking the mode (most frequent score) for each skill. In case of a tie, we applied a conservative rule: selecting the lower value. To further strengthen robustness, we created a combined rating, pooling all 30 runs (15 per model) into a single distribution. Final scores were again derived using the mode, with the same tie-breaking rule. This combined model forms the basis of the transformation ratings presented in this report. All outputs were reviewed and validated by human analysts to ensure consistency, neutrality, and plausibility. We found no evidence of sycophantic model behavior or rating distortion in the model versions used. In comparing the 2024 evaluation (based on GPT-4.0) with our updated 2025 assessment, we observed a consistent upward shift in model-rated capabilities. To ensure this shift reflects real improvements — not definitional changes — we reviewed all skill definitions. Of the 2,884 skills, only 11 had minor updates. Only one (HTML) showed both a definition change and a significant rating shift, and the change of the definition was minimal. We are confident that the broader trend reflects genuine gains in GenAI’s applied capability. We also note that theoretical knowledge is no longer a meaningful differentiator in GenAI’s true ability to perform a skill — GenAI performs reliably in this area across nearly all skills. What varies is its problem-solving ability and whether physical execution is required. Series of bar charts titled &#8220;Skill rating comparison across Claude Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and consolidated rating&#8221; shows the share of 2900 US skills rated at a given level across four dimensions: theoretical knowledge, physical execution, replacement likelihood, and problem-solving ability. Finally, we mapped each skill’s transformation rating to more than 53.5 million US job postings published on Indeed between May 2024 and April 2025, allowing for estimates of transformation exposure at the occupational level. Results are segmented using the sector classification framework from Indeed’s Job Posting Index (JPI) . In addition to structured ratings, this year’s analysis incorporates a new qualitative dimension: a systematic review of the “thinking” processes and reasoning behind the LLMs’ evaluations. For selected skill families and occupations — including programming and software development, as well as patient care and healthcare administration in nursing — we examined not only the model’s ratings outputs, but also the underlying thinking process by the models themselves. This approach allows us to offer a deeper and more nuanced assessment of how GenAI is reshaping jobs. This analysis reflects a deliberately conservative estimate of GenAI’s labor market potential. We use general-purpose models and apply strict rating consolidation. Domain-specific or fine-tuned models may perform better in specific tasks. Under ideal conditions of GenAI adoption, GenAI infrastructure optimization, GenAI workforce education and more, the GSTI should be interpreted as a baseline index of transformation potential, not an upper bound. But these are all very complicated variables that may unfold in many unforeseen ways, each of which is likely to notably impact GenAI performance in a professional environment.

        "content": "59 AI Job Statistics: Future of U.S. Jobs Author: Timothy Prestianni Academically Reviewed By: The Editorial Advisory Board Read: 9 mins Published On: 30 May 2025 Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the U.S. job market, sparking widespread conversations and concerns about AI and job loss, AI taking jobs, and how many jobs AI will replace. This statistical roundup compiles the latest data and trends on AI replacing jobs, job loss statistics, and the broader impact of artificial intelligence on employment. 30% of current U.S. jobs could be automated by 2030 By 2030, 30% of current U.S. jobs could be fully automated, while 60% will see significant task-level changes due to AI integration. This shift highlights the urgent need for workers to adapt through upskilling and technological proficiency. General AI Impact on the U.S. Job Market AI is accelerating automation across sectors, with profound implications for employment in the United States. From job losses and workforce reductions to shifting career paths and retraining needs, these statistics outline the scale and speed of AI’s disruption. 30% of current U.S. jobs could be automated by 2030; 60% will have tasks significantly modified by AI. 300 million jobs could be lost to AI globally, representing 9.1% of all jobs worldwide. 23.5% of U.S. companies have replaced workers with ChatGPT or similar AI tools. 49% of companies using ChatGPT say it has replaced workers. In May 2023, 3,900 U.S. job losses were directly linked to AI, making it the seventh-largest eliminator of jobs that month. 13.7% of U.S. workers report having lost their job to a robot or AI-driven automation. Since 2000, automation has resulted in 1.7 million U.S. manufacturing jobs lost. 40% of employers expect to reduce their workforce where AI can automate tasks. By 2030, 14% of employees globally will have been forced to change their career because of AI. 20 million U.S. workers are expected to retrain in new careers or AI use in the next three years. 30% of U.S. workers fear their job will be replaced by AI or similar technology by 2025. Automating half of current tasks worldwide could take another 20 years. Entry-level jobs are especially vulnerable, with nearly 50 million U.S. jobs at risk in coming years. As entry-level roles decline, salary expectations are also shifting downward. AI could impact nearly 60% of jobs in advanced economies, but only 26% in low-income countries. AI’s impact is expected to be most disruptive in the next 10–30 years, with a possible 50% of jobs automated by 2045. Which Jobs Will Thrive? While many jobs face automation, certain roles are expected to flourish in the AI era. These statistics highlight occupations projected to grow, including those in technology, healthcare, skilled trades, and emerging AI-related fields. This section also explores why some jobs are more resilient to automation and the new opportunities created by AI adoption Software developers are projected to see a 17.9% increase in employment from 2023 to 2033. Job postings for entry-level software engineers grew 47% between October 2023 and November 2024. The share of jobs in STEM fields grew from 6.5% in 2010 to nearly 10% in 2024, an almost 50% increase Installation, repair, and maintenance jobs are at lower risk from AI and remain in demand. Construction and skilled trades are among the least threatened by AI automation. Personal services (e.g., food service, medical assistants, cleaners) are less likely to be replaced by AI and have rebounded post-pandemic, with food preparation and serving jobs expected to add over 500,000 positions by 2033 as in-person services remain essential. Healthcare roles (nurses, therapists, aides) are projected to grow as AI augments rather than replaces these jobs; for example, nurse practitioners are projected to grow by 52% from 2023 to 2033, much faster than the average for all occupations. AI and data science specialists are among the fastest-growing job categories in 2025. Cybersecurity professionals are in growing demand due to increased digital threats with a 32% growth in information security analyst jobs from 2022 to 2032, far outpacing the average for all occupations. Renewable energy technicians (solar, wind) are projected to see double-digit growth rates, with solar photovoltaic installers expected to grow by 22% and wind turbine technicians by 44% from 2022 to 2032. AI trainers, ethicists, and explainability experts are emerging roles created by AI adoption. AI support roles (prompt engineers, AI operations) are new job types with rapid growth. Personal financial advisors will likely continue to see strong employment growth despite AI, with the BLS projecting a 13% increase in jobs from 2022 to 2032, as clients continue to value human expertise for complex financial decisions. Which Jobs Will Disappear? Not all roles will survive the AI revolution. This section details the occupations most vulnerable to automation, from clerical and administrative positions to routine manufacturing and customer service jobs. Clerical and administrative roles (secretaries, data entry clerks) are among the first to be automated. Bank tellers and cashiers are seeing rapid declines as digital banking and self-checkout expand. Employment of bank tellers is projected to decline by 15% from 2023 to 2033, eliminating about 51,400 jobs, while cashier employment is projected to decline by 11% (a reduction of 353,100 jobs) over the same period Routine manufacturing jobs: 1.7 million lost since 2000 due to automation. Telemarketers and call center agents are increasingly replaced by AI-driven chatbots. Medical transcriptionists’ employment is projected to decline by 4.7% from 2023 to 2033. Customer service representatives’ employment is projected to decline by 5.0% from 2023 to 2033. Credit analysts’ employment is projected to decline by 3.9% from 2023 to 2033. Low-paid service work has seen flat or declining employment since 2019, with AI cited as a contributing factor. Education and Skills for Future-Proof Careers As AI transforms the nature of work, the demand for new skills is rising sharply. The skillsets required for job security and advancement are evolving with the growing importance of technological literacy, human-centric abilities, and lifelong learning. 39% of key job skills in the U.S. are expected to change by 2030, down from 44% in 2023. 59% of workers will require upskilling or reskilling by 2030. Technological skills are projected to grow in importance faster than any other skill category over the next five years. Eight of the top ten most requested skills in U.S. job postings are durable (human) skills. Communication, leadership, metacognition, critical thinking, collaboration, and character skills each appear in ~15 million U.S. job postings annually. 66% of all tasks in 2030 will still require human skills or a human-technology combination. Employers expect creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility to rise sharply in importance by 2030. Analytical thinking, curiosity, and lifelong learning are among the top 10 skills on the rise for future jobs. Data literacy is now considered “the new workplace currency” and is critical across all major U.S. industries, as businesses must interpret and act on an estimated 182 zettabytes of data by 2025. AI and machine learning skills are increasingly fundamental, not just for tech workers but for all professionals. Cybersecurity and technological literacy are among the fastest-growing skill demands in the U.S. job market. Project management and UX design are among the most recommended upskilling paths for U.S. workers in 2025. Lifelong learning and upskilling are now a top priority for 75% of U.S. employers. Impact by Generation AI’s influence on employment is not uniform across age groups. This section explores how different generations are experiencing and responding to AI-driven changes, with a focus on the heightened vulnerability of younger workers, shifting attitudes toward education, and generational trends in upskilling and workforce participation. Workers aged 18–24 are 129% more likely than those over 65 to worry AI will make their job obsolete. 49% of Gen Z job seekers believe AI has reduced the value of their college education. Entry-level jobs, disproportionately filled by young workers, are especially at risk, with nearly 50 million U.S. jobs affected. 14% of all workers have already been displaced by AI, but the rate is higher among younger and mid-career workers in tech and creative fields. Impact by Gender The impact of AI on jobs also varies by gender, with women disproportionately represented in roles at high risk of automation. These statistics analyze the gendered effects of AI-driven job displacement, the challenges of underrepresentation in tech fields, and the potential for AI to both mitigate and exacerbate workplace inequalities 79% of employed women in the U.S. work in jobs at high risk of automation, compared to 58% of men. Globally, 4.7% of women’s jobs face severe disruption potential from AI, versus 2.4% for men. In high-income nations, 9.6% of women’s jobs are at highest risk for AI automation, compared to 3.2% for men. Women are underrepresented in AI and STEM fields, limiting access to new, high-paying tech jobs created by AI. AI in HR and recruitment could help reduce gender bias if designed carefully, but may also perpetuate or worsen bias if algorithms are not transparent and inclusive. Conclusion The rise of artificial intelligence is reshaping the U.S. job market with speed and scale. As shown in these 59 AI job statistics, AI is not only displacing certain roles but also creating new opportunities that demand advanced technical skills, human-centered abilities, and continuous learning. While jobs in areas like administration and manufacturing face growing risks, professions in healthcare, technology, skilled trades, and AI itself are projected to expand. The data makes one thing clear: preparing for the future of work requires adaptability. Individuals who invest in upskilling, embrace lifelong learning, and build resilience will be better positioned to thrive in an AI-influenced economy. At the same time, institutions and employers must focus on equitable access to education and training to ensure that all generations and all communities can benefit from the opportunities AI brings. Artificial intelligence is not just replacing jobs, it’s redefining them. Understanding these trends is the first step in preparing for what’s ahead.

Image: Reuters/Jeenah Moon Atul Kumar Data-rich industries are the most prone to being disrupted by AI. Data-poor industries are scrabbling to digitize in order to enjoy the benefits of AI – but experiencing greater friction with established practices. Employees and job-seekers must focus on opportunities that combine tech capabilities with human judgement and business needs. Everyone talks about how AI is going to take jobs, and that&#x27;s somewhat true. We&#x27;re worried about AI job takeover – yet we don&#x27;t fully understand how it&#x27;s going to happen, when it&#x27;s going to occur or how much time we have to prepare. Most people believe that task complexity determines whether AI adoption will be fast or slow. This assumption is completely wrong. As the Sun Tzu saying goes: &quot;Know yourself and your enemies and you would be ever victorious.&quot; So you need to understand the following dynamics. Have you read? How AI’s impact on value creation, jobs and productivity is coming into focus AI skills are becoming more important than job experience. Here’s how job seekers can adapt How to harness the power of generative AI for better jobs? Experts share their views How AI works The mechanics of AI are still somewhat unclear, even to experts. However, we do know one important thing: it learns. Have you ever gotten shocked while fiddling with electronics? I have, and that experience taught me never to do it again. We humans learn from experience. AI models learn from data. An AI model with limited data is like a toddler. In contrast, one with extensive data is like an experienced grandfather. The data paradox Which is harder: driving a car or writing code? Most would say coding. Yet in AI development, the opposite seems true. Large Language Models (LLMs) are relatively new. Before ChatGPT, few associated AI with chatbots – more likely the Terminator. The LLM era began around 2013-2014 with neural networks like word2vec . Autonomous driving, on the other hand, began in the 1980s. In 1987, Ernst Dickmanns’ team had a Mercedes-Benz van drive itself at 96 km/h on a German highway using computer vision. Despite this massive head start, autonomous vehicles still lag behind LLMs. While ChatGPT performs reliably across countless scenarios, AI drivers remain inconsistent. But why? Companies like Tesla and Waymo have invested billions. Yet if a new company wanted to enter the space – even with brilliant engineers and unlimited funding – they’d still need thousands of hours of diverse driving data. Some accident types are so rare they’re nearly impossible to train for. Meanwhile, LLMs train on the entire internet – a data-rich playground. Hence, AI is more likely to replace coders than drivers not because coding is easier, but because the data is easier to come by. AI is basically like that kid in college who had access to all the old exams and study guides. Of course they&#x27;re going to crush the test compared to someone scrambling with incomplete notes from a few lectures. That&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening in the job market. Some industries are drowning in useful data that AI can learn from. Others? They&#x27;re working with scraps. The numbers are pretty stark. Industries with tons of good data could have AI adoption rates around 60-70% . Meanwhile, sectors without much data might struggle with less than 25% . The jobs getting hit hard Software development is getting hammered. GitHub hosts over 420 million repositories, including at least 28 million public ones – millions of examples of how to solve programming problems. Tools like GitHub Copilot study all that code and learn to write programmes independently. Three-quarters of developers now use AI assistants. Customer support is another sitting duck. It is ripe for AI automation due to abundant data. IBM notes AI uses call, email and ticket data to enhance responses and cut costs by 23.5%. Finance also heavily employs machine learning in algorithmic trading, with high-frequency trading accounting for around 70% of US equity market volume, leveraging vast market and transaction data for predictions . Sectors with lack of data Healthcare ’s AI adoption lags due to scarce public data. Less than 10% of surgical datasets are publicly accessible , limited by HIPAA and fragmented sources. Patient data is scattered across different hospitals, insurance companies and clinics. AI can&#x27;t learn effectively when the information is locked away in a thousand different places. Construction might be the most AI-proof industry out there . Not because building houses is rocket science, but because the industry barely keeps digital records. Every project is different, documentation is terrible, and there&#x27;s no standard way to track what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Education ’s AI potential is curbed by student privacy laws. The US Department of Education notes that FERPA restricts data collection and sharing, limiting AI’s use of student data. In response to these data shortages, some industries are resorting to invasive measures. Hospitals are installing comprehensive video monitoring in operating rooms, ostensibly to train surgical AI, but this creates unprecedented surveillance of medical professionals. AI-powered proctoring systems that track students’ eye movements, facial expressions and typing patterns during exams are under development , raising concerns about surveillance systems that may far exceed their original purpose. The economic reality The AI transformation isn&#x27;t hitting every part of the economy the same way. In data-rich sectors, we&#x27;re witnessing what economists call &quot;creative destruction&quot; at breakneck speed. Old jobs vanish almost overnight while new ones emerge, but these new positions often require completely different skills and tend to cluster in tech hubs. A customer service centre that once employed 500 people might transform into 50 AI oversight specialists working from a single location. Data-poor industries face an entirely different challenge. They must digitize to stay competitive, but this creates daily friction between cutting-edge technology and established practices. The transformation happens more slowly but cuts deeper, restructuring entire departments rather than simply replacing individual roles. Sure, new jobs appear, but they are not one-to-one swaps. Ninety-two million jobs are projected to be displaced by 2030, with 170 million new ones emerging . But these aren&#x27;t direct exchanges happening in the same locations with the same individuals. The real challenge isn&#x27;t only about job numbers; it&#x27;s about the gap between where jobs vanish and where they come back, between the skills workers possess and the skills that new roles require. How to adapt For job-seekers, the key insight is that industry boundaries are blurring faster than job categories are crystallizing. Rather than focusing solely on traditional career paths, look for roles that bridge domains – positions that combine human judgement with AI capabilities, or that translate between technical systems and business needs. Reframe your skills inventory around adaptability, not just expertise. Instead of listing what you&#x27;ve done, identify how you learn, solve problems and work with new systems. Employers increasingly value people who can navigate uncertainty and integrate new tools into existing workflows. Your ability to successfully adopt the last major change at your workplace may matter more than your proficiency with any specific software. Target the friction points. Every organization implementing AI faces the same challenge: how to make sophisticated technology work within messy human systems. Look for roles in charge of management, training or process optimization within AI-adopting companies. These positions often don&#x27;t require deep technical knowledge, but do need people who understand how organizations actually function when theory meets practice. Consider the “last mile” opportunities in your current industry. While tech hubs generate headlines, every sector needs people who can bridge the gap between AI capabilities and local implementation. Healthcare systems need someone who understands both patient care and data analytics. Manufacturing plants need operators who can work alongside automated systems. Often, your existing industry knowledge combined with basic AI literacy creates more opportunities than starting from scratch in a completely new field. Loading...

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Jack Kelly covers career growth, job market and workplace trends. Follow Author Apr 25, 2025, 09:16am EDT Apr 30, 2025, 02:10pm EDT Share Save Comment Add Us On Google Artificial intelligence will soon dominate the job market. Getty Images Artificial intelligence is advancing at breakneck speed. The big question is how long it will take until technology dominates the job market. You should start thinking about your own career. Will you be caught up in the change? With the U.S. navigating a $36 trillion debt, tariff tensions, and economic uncertainty, the specter of disruption from AI adds urgency for workers to protect themselves. Artificial intelligence is expected to fundamentally transform the global workforce by 2050, according to reports from PwC, McKinsey, and the World Economic Forum. Estimates suggest that up to 60% of current jobs will require significant adaptation due to AI. Automation and intelligent systems will become an integral part of the workplace. o remain competitive, invest in skills like critical thinking and digital fluency. Target AI-resilient sectors like healthcare or education. Advocate for retraining programs to reinvent your career. As macro investor and founder of the Bridgewater hedge fund Ray Dalio warns, the economy’s future hinges on balancing AI’s power with human potential. He says those who prepare now will shape the world of tomorrow. Things Are Changing Quickly Estimates vary, but experts converge on a transformative window of 10 to 30 years for AI to reshape most jobs. A McKinsey report projects that by 2030, 30% of current U.S. jobs could be automated , with 60% significantly altered by AI tools. Goldman Sachs predicts up that to 50% of jobs could be fully automated by 2045, driven by generative AI and robotics. MORE FOR YOU Goldman Sachs previously estimated that 300 million jobs could be lost to AI, affecting 25% of the global labor market. On the bright side, AI is least threatening to labor-intensive careers in construction, skilled trades, installation and repair, and maintenance. Dalio warns of a “great deleveraging” where AI accelerates productivity but displaces workers faster than new roles emerge, potentially within two decades. Larry Fink, the CEO of Black Rock, speaking at the Economic Club of New York this month, cautioned that AI’s impact is already visible in sectors like finance and legal services, predicting a “restructuring” of white-collar work by 2035. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, estimates in his shareholder letter that AI will dominate repetitive tasks within 15 years. The actual pace depends on technological breakthroughs, regulatory frameworks, and economic incentives. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, argues that corporate adoption of AI is accelerating due to cost pressures, potentially shrinking timelines. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent counters that AI could bolster U.S. competitiveness if paired with retraining, delaying mass displacement. By 2040, AI will likely automate or transform 50% to 60% of jobs, with full dominance (80% and higher) possible by 2050, assuming steady innovation. Which Jobs Will AI Take First to Last? AI’s impact will not be uniform. Some jobs will fall quickly, while others resist longer. Jobs like data entry, scheduling, and customer service are already being overtaken by AI tools like chatbots and robotic process automation. A 2024 study by the Institute for Public Policy Research found 60% of administrative tasks are automatable. Fink notes that BlackRock is streamlining back-office functions with AI, cutting costs. These roles, requiring repetitive data processing, face near-term obsolescence as AI’s accuracy and scalability improve. Bookkeeping, financial modeling, and basic data analysis are highly vulnerable. AI platforms like Bloomberg’s Terminal enhancements can already crunch numbers and generate reports faster than humans. Dimon warns that JPMorgan is automating routine banking tasks, with 20% of analytical roles at risk by 2030. Paralegal work, contract drafting, and legal research are prime targets, as AI tools like Harvey and CoCounsel automate document analysis with 90% accuracy, according to a 2025 Stanford study. Dalio highlights AI’s ability to parse vast datasets, threatening research-heavy roles in academia and consulting. Senior legal strategy and courtroom advocacy, however, will resist longer due to human judgment needs. Graphic design, copywriting, and basic journalism face disruption from tools like DALL-E and GPT-derived platforms, which produce content at scale. A 2024 Pew Research Center report notes that 30% of media jobs could be automated by 2035. Ackman, commenting on X, predicts AI-generated content will dominate advertising soon but argues human creativity in storytelling and high art will endure longer, delaying full automation. Software development, engineering, and data science are dual-edged: AI boosts productivity but also automates routine coding and design tasks. A 2025 World Economic Forum report flags that 40% of programming tasks could be automated by 2040 . Bessent sees growth in AI-adjacent roles like cybersecurity, but standardized STEM work will gradually cede to algorithms. Complex innovation, like breakthrough research and development, will remain human-driven longer. Diagnostic AI and robotic surgery are advancing, but empathy-driven roles like nursing, therapy, and social work are harder to automate. A 2023 Lancet study estimates 25% of medical administrative tasks could vanish by 2035, but patient-facing care requires human trust. Teaching, especially in nuanced fields like philosophy or early education, and high-level management jobs rely on emotional intelligence and adaptability, which AI struggles to replicate. A 2024 OECD report suggests only 10% of teaching tasks are automatable by 2040. Dimon and Ackman stress that strategic leadership, navigating ambiguity and inspiring teams, will remain human-centric.
