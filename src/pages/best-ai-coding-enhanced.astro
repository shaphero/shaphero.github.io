GPT-5 is here. As per OpenAI, it’s more than just a faster or bigger version of what came before. Building on the strengths of the GPT series and the “o-series” reasoning-focused models, GPT-5 doesn’t just answer questions. It adapts its approach based on the complexity of your request, and many users have reported seeing that in action. Under the hood, GPT-5 isn’t just your regular LLM; it’s more like a brain with different “modes,” quietly picking the right one for whatever you ask. The result? Conversations that feel more fluid, more responsive, and a lot more human. Many reports describe it as outperforming Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 (which you can try here ) in early coding and reasoning side‑by‑side evaluations. This article offers a detailed comparison between the two, clearing the noise and opinions that we’re seeing. Let’s tackle it. GPT-5 Model Family Overview Bind AI The GPT-5 family is the latest evolution of OpenAI’s generative models, advancing beyond GPT-4o and GPT-4.5. It features significant improvements in reasoning, adaptability, and tool use, building on previous architectural refinements and efficiency gains while introducing brand-new capabilities. • Adaptive Reasoning Modes: – Rapid Response Mode: Optimized for speed, delivering concise, high-quality answers with minimal latency. – Deep Reasoning Mode: Engages in multi-step, internally simulated reasoning chains with dynamically allocated “thinking depth,” allowing for more complex problem-solving and nuanced analysis. • Integrated Multi-Tool Orchestration: GPT-5 can autonomously coordinate between multiple tools—such as code interpreters, database connectors, and web retrieval—within a single conversational thread, making it far more capable in complex, multi-stage workflows. • Persistent Context Awareness: Bind AI With a context window exceeding 200K tokens (400K in select cases), GPT-5 can maintain and reference vast amounts of information across sessions, enabling richer narrative continuity, large-document comprehension, and multi-day project memory. How GPT-5’s Architecture Differs from GPT-4 GPT-4 was already a big leap forward, but GPT-5 takes things a step further by changing how the model actually thinks and organizes information. Instead of running every request through the same process, GPT-5 can switch between different “mental modes” depending on what you’re asking. If it’s a quick question, it uses a fast, lightweight path. If it’s a tricky, multi-step problem, it calls on deeper reasoning components that break the task into parts before answering. It also has a much bigger memory — over 200,000 tokens — so it can keep track of far more context at once. That means it can read and remember an entire book, or follow a long-running conversation without losing the thread. And unlike GPT-4, it’s built to work smoothly with other tools and sources right out of the box, blending what it knows with fresh, real-world information on the fly. Let’s see how Claude 4 stacks up. Claude 4: Structure &amp; Feature Deep Dive Anthropic Claude 4 was officially launched in May 2025, introducing two main versions: Claude Opus 4 – flagship, highest‑tier, paid version Claude Sonnet 4 – generalist, available even to free users Read a detailed comparative analysis of these models here . And in case you missed the Claude Opus 4.1 release, check it out here . Hybrid Reasoning Modes Both models support two modes: Near‑Instant: rapid answers for simple queries Extended Thinking: multi‑step, slower mode for deep reasoning and planning. They also support interleaved tool execution, switching between internal thinking and tools (like search) during reasoning. Context Window &amp; Memory Both offer a massive ~200K‑token context window, allowing retention of lengthy prompts, code, documents, or conversations. Opus 4, when given file access, can generate persistent memory artifacts—caching facts over long workflows for improved coherence. Safety &amp; Transparency Features Anthropic assigned Opus 4 a safety classification of ASL‑3, given its potency and potential misuse risk—especially in bioweapons or cyberattacks—triggering strict internal safeguards, anti‑jailbreak, and bounty programs. Claude 4 also introduces “thinking summaries”, condensing reasoning chains into user‑friendly explanations, improving transparency while limiting over‑exposed chain‑of‑thought. Claude 4 Pricing &amp; Access Claude Sonnet 4: Free-tier availability; API access $3Mtokinput-$15/Mtokoutput. Claude Opus 4: Paid‑tier only; API pricing $15Mtokinput-$75Mtokoutput per million tokens. Opus 4 is also available via Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex AI platforms, widening enterprise reach. GPT-5 vs Claude 4: Coding and Agentic Abilities Bind AI Opus 4, touted as “the best coding model in the world,” shines on SWE-bench (≈ 72.5%) and Terminal-bench (≈ 43.2%)—and in high-compute settings climbs even higher (≈ 79.4% SWE; 50% Terminal). It autonomously executed a task equivalent to playing Pokémon Red continuously for 24 hours, underscoring its strength in long-running, agentic workflows. While it doesn’t match GPT-5’s multimodal reach or hybrid “fast-vs-deep” reasoning architecture, Opus 4 remains exceptional for sustained, precise coding and reasoning tasks, aided by strong memory and transparent tool use. Sonnet 4, though more lightweight and accessible, still outperforms many competitors: SWE-bench ≈ 72.7%, GPQA ≈ 75.4%, MMLU ≈ 86.5%, and robust results on TAU-bench and visual reasoning benchmarks—landing between Claude 3.7 and GPT-4.1. In coding performance, it trails GPT-5’s ≈ 74.9% SWE-bench score by a slim margin, but its efficiency and reliability keep it a strong choice for users who value speed without sacrificing too much depth. GPT-5 vs Claude 4: Benchmarks Bind AI GPT-5 outperforms in benchmark scores, versatility, and cost-effectiveness for high-volume tasks. Claude 4 (Opus 4) is reliable for continuous coding, while Sonnet 4 excels in general reasoning at the free tier. Both models are top performers, but GPT-5 leads overall. But that’s not to say it’s ‘too much’ better than Claude 4. Reddit and X jokes go a long way in explaining that; TroyQuasar via X GPT-5 vs Claude 4: Pricing Comparison Here’s a pricing comparison between the different GPT-5 and Claude 4 models: Bind AI GPT-5 is incredibly cheaper than Claude Sonnet 4, costing around two-thirds less for both input and output tokens. That makes it a compelling choice for developers or businesses watching their token budget closely—especially in high-volume scenarios. If you just need the absolute cheapest option, then GPT-5 Mini or GPT-5 Nano drop prices even further: for example, GPT-5 Nano charges only $0.05 for input and $0.40 for output per million tokens—a fraction of Claude&#8217;s rates. By contrast, Claude Opus 4 comes with a premium price tag ($15 input / $75 output) tailored for extremely demanding use cases, but it&#8217;s significantly more expensive. OpenAI GPT 5 vs Claude 4: Use‑Cases &amp; Fit Developer Tools / Coding Agents Claude Opus 4: Provides strong capabilities for enterprise code agents—mass refactoring, CLI workflows, multi-file edits, extended memory context. GPT‑5: Early reports suggest it may exceed Sonnet 4 in coding tasks; if it matches Opus capabilities, it could challenge Claude in this domain. General Purpose Query &amp; Reasoning Claude Sonnet 4: Reliable generalist model available free; good for writing, analysis, tutoring, lighter code help. GPT‑5: Promises dynamic speed/effort; could offer faster responses for simple queries and deeper reasoning when needed—if efficient, it may rival or surpass Sonnet 4. Agentic Automation &amp; Multi‑Step Workflows Opus 4: Proven for long-running agentic tasks (e.g., playing Pokémon for 24h, code tasks). GPT‑5: Unknown capabilities in sustained autonomous workflows—dependent on internal tools and memory support. Budget &amp; Tiered Access Sonnet 4: Free access makes it exceptionally attractive for broad use. GPT‑5: Likely behind ChatGPT Plus/Enterprise paywalls—pricing not yet known. Claude’s explicit token‑level pricing gives clarity to enterprise users. OpenAI GPT 5 vs Claude 4 Summary Coding &amp; sustained agent tasks → Claude Opus 4 still holds a solid lead with proven benchmarks and sustained seven-hour autonomous workflows. But GPT-5 is quickly catching up — early reports and user experiences suggest it outperforms Anthropic’s previous reasoning models in coding and agentic tasks. General-purpose reasoning &amp; free access → Claude Sonnet 4 remains a dependable free-tier general-purpose option, known for strong reasoning and accessibility. That said, GPT-5 broadens the landscape with faster dynamic responses and is available in mini and nano variants that enhance accessibility and performance for lower-cost use. Dynamic effort allocation → GPT-5 now features a built-in model routing system that intelligently picks between “fast mode” and deeper “thinking” models based on task needs — surpassing Claude’s manual mode switching of near-instant vs extended thinking in Claude 4. Safety &amp; transparency → Claude 4 maintains its reputation for safety, with features like “thinking summaries” and a cautious hybrid approach. GPT-5, meanwhile, introduces “safe completions,” significantly reduces hallucinations, and aims to transparently explain when it can’t comply or lacks certainty. However, its full safety mechanisms are still being assessed. Value proposition → Sonnet 4 shines as the go-to free-tier model for general use, while Opus 4’s cost ($15 input / $75 output) reflects its enterprise-grade capabilities. GPT-5, by contrast, is priced far lower — $1.25 input / $10 output per million tokens for the standard model, $0.25 / $2 for GPT-5 Mini, and $0.05 / $0.40 for GPT-5 Nano — potentially offering a much more cost-efficient path to high-end reasoning and coding performance.

Try with Claude 4 Try with GPT-5 The Bottom Line Claude 4’s Opus and Sonnet versions are effective tools for coding, reasoning, and safety, with Opus 4 excelling in long projects. With GPT-5 now available, it features a smart &#8220;thinking&#8221; capability that adapts between quick responses and deeper reasoning. It excels in coding, health, visual tasks, and real-world assessments while reducing errors. If GPT-5 can match Sonnet 4’s efficiency and come close to Opus 4’s strengths in planning and persistence—while maintaining safety—AI could undergo significant changes. But yes, Claude 4 remains a reliable choice in production settings .

Loading… Share Introduction Today, we’re releasing GPT‑5 in our API platform—our best model yet for coding and agentic tasks. GPT‑5 is state-of-the-art (SOTA) across key coding benchmarks, scoring 74.9% on SWE-bench Verified and 88% on Aider polyglot. We trained GPT‑5 to be a true coding collaborator. It excels at producing high-quality code and handling tasks such as fixing bugs, editing code, and answering questions about complex codebases. The model is steerable and collaborative—it can follow very detailed instructions with high accuracy and can provide upfront explanations of its actions before and between tool calls. The model also excels at front-end coding, beating OpenAI o3 at frontend web development 70% of the time in internal testing. We trained GPT‑5 on real-world coding tasks in collaboration with early testers across startups and enterprises. Cursor says GPT‑5 is “the smartest model [they’ve] used” and “remarkably intelligent, easy to steer, and even has a personality [they] haven’t seen in other models.” Windsurf shared GPT‑5 is SOTA on their evals and “has half the tool calling error rate over other frontier models.” Vercel says “it’s the best frontend AI model, hitting top performance across both the aesthetic sense and the code quality, putting it in a category of its own.” GPT‑5 also excels at long-running agentic tasks—achieving SOTA results on τ 2 -bench telecom (96.7%), a tool-calling benchmark released just 2 months ago. GPT‑5’s improved tool intelligence lets it reliably chain together dozens of tool calls—both in sequence and in parallel—without losing its way, making it far better at executing complex, real-world tasks end to end. It also follows tool instructions more precisely, is better at handling tool errors, and excels at long-context content retrieval. Manus says GPT‑5 “achieved the best performance [they’ve] ever seen from a single model on [their] internal benchmarks.” Notion says “[the model’s] rapid responses, especially in low reasoning mode, make GPT‑5 an ideal model when you need complex tasks solved in one shot.” Inditex shared “what truly sets [GPT‑5] apart is the depth of its reasoning: nuanced, multi-layered answers that reflect real subject-matter understanding.” We’re introducing new features in our API to give developers more control over model responses. GPT‑5 supports a new verbosity parameter (values: low , medium , high ) to help control whether answers are short and to the point or long and comprehensive. GPT‑5’s reasoning_effort parameter can now take a minimal value to get answers back faster, without extensive reasoning first. We’ve also added a new tool type—custom tools—to let GPT‑5 call tools with plaintext instead of JSON. Custom tools support constraining by developer-supplied context-free grammars. We’re releasing GPT‑5 in three sizes in the API— gpt-5 , gpt-5-mini , and gpt-5-nano —to give developers more flexibility to trade off performance, cost, and latency. While GPT‑5 in ChatGPT is a system of reasoning, non-reasoning, and router models, GPT‑5 in the API platform is the reasoning model that powers maximum performance in ChatGPT. Notably, GPT‑5 with minimal reasoning is a different model than the non-reasoning model in ChatGPT, and is better tuned for developers. The non-reasoning model used in ChatGPT is available as gpt-5-chat-latest . To read about GPT‑5 in ChatGPT, and learn more about other ChatGPT improvements, see our research blog . For more on how enterprises are excited to use GPT‑5, see our enterprise blog ⁠ . Coding GPT‑5 is the strongest coding model we’ve ever released. It outperforms o3 across coding benchmarks and real-world use cases, and has been fine-tuned to shine in agentic coding products like Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and Codex CLI. GPT‑5 impressed our alpha testers, setting records on many of their private internal evals. Early feedback on GPT-5 for real-world coding tasks Cursor Windsurf Vercel JetBrains Factory Lovable GitLab Augment Code GitHub Cognition “GPT-5 is the smartest coding model we&#x27;ve used. Our team has found GPT-5 to be remarkably intelligent, easy to steer, and even to have a personality we haven’t seen in any other model. It not only catches tricky, deeply-hidden bugs but can also run long, multi-turn background agents to see complex tasks through to the finish—the kinds of problems that used to leave other models stuck. It’s become our daily driver for everything from scoping and planning PRs to completing end-to-end builds.” Michael Truell, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Cursor On SWE-bench Verified, an evaluation based on real-world software engineering tasks, GPT‑5 scores 74.9%, up from o3’s 69.1%. Notably, GPT‑5 achieves its high score with greater efficiency and speed: relative to o3 at high reasoning effort, GPT‑5 uses 22% fewer output tokens and 45% fewer tool calls. In SWE-bench Verified ⁠ , a model is given a code repository and issue description, and must generate a patch to solve the issue. Text labels indicate the reasoning effort. Our scores omit 23 of 500 problems whose solutions did not reliably pass on our infrastructure. GPT‑5 was given a short prompt that emphasized verifying solutions thoroughly; the same prompt did not benefit o3. On Aider polyglot, an evaluation of code editing, GPT‑5 sets a new record of 88%, a one-third reduction in error rate compared to o3. In Aider polygot ⁠ (opens in a new window) (diff), a model is given a coding exercise from Exercism and must write its solution as a code diff. Reasoning models were run with high reasoning effort. We’ve also found GPT‑5 to be excellent at digging deep into codebases to answer questions about how various pieces work or interoperate. In a codebase as complicated as OpenAI’s reinforcement learning stack, we’re finding that GPT‑5 can help us reason about and answer questions about our code, accelerating our own day-to-day work. Frontend engineering When producing frontend code for web apps, GPT‑5 is more aesthetically-minded, ambitious, and accurate. In side-by-side comparisons with o3, GPT‑5 was preferred by our testers 70% of the time. Here are some fun, cherry-picked examples of what GPT‑5 can do with a single prompt: Espresso Lab website Audio step sequencer app Outer space game Prompt: Please generate a beautiful, realistic landing page for a service that provides the ultimate coffee enthusiast a $200/month subscription that provides equipment rental and coaching for coffee roasting and creating the ultimate espresso. The target audience is a bay area middle-aged person who might work in tech and is educated, has disposable income, and is passionate about the art and science of coffee. Optimize for conversion for a 6 month signup. See more examples by GPT‑5 in our gallery here ⁠ (opens in a new window) . Coding collaboration GPT‑5 is a better collaborator, particularly in agentic coding products like Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and Codex CLI. While it works, GPT‑5 can output plans, updates, and recaps in between tool calls. Relative to our past models, GPT‑5 is more proactive at completing ambitious tasks without pausing for your go-ahead or balking at high complexity. Here’s an example of how GPT‑5 can look while tackling a complex task (in this case, creating a website for a restaurant): After the user asks for a website for their restaurant, GPT‑5 shares a quick plan, scaffolds the app, installs dependencies, creates the site content, runs a build to check for compilation errors, summarizes its work, and suggests potential next steps. This video has been sped up ~3x to save you the wait; the full duration to create the website was about three minutes. Agentic tasks Beyond agentic coding, GPT‑5 is better at agentic tasks generally. GPT‑5 sets new records on benchmarks of instruction following (69.6% on Scale MultiChallenge, as graded by o3‑mini) and tool calling (96.7% on τ 2 -bench telecom). Improved tool intelligence allows GPT‑5 to more reliably chain together actions to accomplish real-world tasks. Early feedback on GPT-5 for agentic tasks Manus Mercado Libre Notion Genspark Inditex Zendesk Canva Atlassian Harvey BBVA Clay Uber “GPT-5 is a big step up. It achieved the best performance we’ve ever seen from a single model on our internal benchmarks. GPT-5 excelled across various agentic tasks—even before we tweaked a single line of code or tailored a prompt. The new preambles and more precise control over tool use enabled a significant leap in the stability and steerability of our agents.” Yichao ‘Peak’ Ji, Co-Founder &amp; Chief Scientist at Manus Instruction following GPT‑5 follows instructions more reliably than any of its predecessors, scoring highly on COLLIE, Scale MultiChallenge, and our internal instruction following eval. In COLLIE ⁠ (opens in a new window) , models must write text that meets various constraints. In Scale MultiChallenge ⁠ (opens in a new window) , models are challenged on multi-turn conversations to properly use four types of information from previous messages. Our scores come from using o3‑mini as a grader, which was more accurate than GPT‑4o. In our internal OpenAI API instruction following eval, models must follow difficult instructions derived from real developer feedback. Reasoning models were run with high reasoning effort. Tool calling We worked hard to improve tool calling in the ways that matter to developers. GPT‑5 is better at following tool instructions, better at dealing with tool errors, and better at proactively making many tool calls in sequence or in parallel. When instructed, GPT‑5 can also output preamble messages before and between tool calls to update users on progress during longer agentic tasks. Two months ago, τ 2 -bench telecom was published by Sierra.ai as a challenging tool use benchmark that highlighted how language model performance drops significantly when interacting with an environment state that can be changed by users. In their publication ⁠ (opens in a new window) , no model scored above 49%. GPT‑5 scores 97%. In τ2-bench ⁠ (opens in a new window) , a model must use tools to accomplish a customer service task, where there may be a user who can communicate and can take actions on the world state. Reasoning models were run with high reasoning effort. GPT‑5 shows strong improvements to long-context performance as well. On OpenAI-MRCR, a measure of long-context information retrieval, GPT‑5 outperforms o3 and GPT‑4.1, by a margin that grows substantially at longer input lengths. In OpenAI-MRCR ⁠ (opens in a new window) (multi-round co-reference resolution), multiple identical “needle” user requests are inserted into long “haystacks” of similar requests and responses, and the model is asked to reproduce the response to i-th needle. Mean match ratio measures the average string match ratio between the model’s response and the correct answer. The points at 256k max input tokens represent averages over 128k–256k input tokens, and so forth. Here, 256k represents 256 * 1,024 = 262,114 tokens. Reasoning models were run with high reasoning effort. We’re also open sourcing BrowseComp Long Context ⁠ (opens in a new window) , a new benchmark for evaluating long-context Q&amp;A. In this benchmark, the model is given a user query, a long list of relevant search results, and must answer the question based on the search results. We designed BrowseComp Long Context to be realistic, difficult, and have reliably correct ground truth answers. On inputs that are 128K–256K tokens, GPT‑5 gives the correct answer 89% of the time. In the API, all GPT‑5 models can accept a maximum of 272,000 input tokens and emit a maximum of 128,000 reasoning &amp; output tokens, for a total context length of 400,000 tokens. Factuality GPT‑5 is more trustworthy than our prior models. On prompts from LongFact and FactScore benchmarks, GPT‑5 makes ~80% fewer factual errors than o3. This makes it better suited for agentic use cases where correctness matters—especially in code, data, and decision-making. Higher scores are worse. LongFact ⁠ (opens in a new window) and FActScore ⁠ (opens in a new window) consist of open-ended fact-seeking questions. We use an LLM-based grader with browsing to fact-check responses on prompts from these benchmarks and measure the fraction of factually incorrect claims. Implementation and grading details can be found in the system card ⁠ . Reasoning models used high reasoning effort. Search was not enabled. Generally, GPT‑5 has been trained to be more self-aware of its own limitations and better able to handle unexpected curveballs. We also trained GPT‑5 to be much more accurate on health questions (read more in our research blog) . As with all language models, we recommend you verify GPT‑5’s work when the stakes are high. New features Minimal reasoning effort Developers can control GPT‑5’s thinking time via the reasoning_effort parameter in the API. In addition to the prior values— low , medium (default), and high —GPT‑5 also supports minimal , which minimizes GPT‑5’s reasoning to return an answer quickly. Higher reasoning_effort values maximize quality and lower values maximize speed. Not all tasks benefit equally from additional reasoning, so we recommend experimenting to see which works best for the use cases you care about. For example, reasoning above low adds little to relatively simple long-context retrieval, but adds quite a few percentage points to CharXiv Reasoning ⁠ (opens in a new window) , a visual reasoning benchmark. GPT‑5’s reasoning effort yields different benefits on different tasks. For CharXiv Reasoning, GPT‑5 was given access to a python tool. Verbosity To help steer the default length of GPT‑5’s answers, we’ve introduced a new API parameter verbosity , which takes values of low , medium (default), and high . If explicit instructions conflict with the verbosity parameters, explicit instructions take precedent. For example, if you ask GPT‑5 to “write a 5 paragraph essay”, the model’s response should always be 5 paragraphs regardless of the verbosity level (however, the paragraphs themselves may be longer or shorter). Verbosity=low Why is the sky blue? Because of Rayleigh scattering. Air molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so they scatter short wavelengths (blue/violet) far more than long ones (red). The scattered blue light comes to your eyes from all directions, making the sky look blue. We don’t see violet as much because the Sun emits less of it, our eyes are less sensitive to it, and some is absorbed in the upper atmosphere. At sunrise and sunset, the longer path through air removes more blue, leaving the sky reddish. Verbosity=medium Why is the sky blue? Because of Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight contains all colors, but air molecules scatter shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) much more strongly than longer wavelengths (red). The scattering strength goes roughly as 1/(wavelength)^4, so blue light gets redirected across the sky and into your eyes. We don’t see a violet sky because: The Sun emits slightly less violet than blue. The upper atmosphere absorbs some violet/UV. Human eyes are less sensitive to violet. At sunrise and sunset, sunlight passes through more atmosphere, scattering out most of the blues along the way and leaving the longer red/orange wavelengths to dominate. Verbosity=high Why is the sky blue? The sky looks blue because sunlight gets scattered by the tiny molecules in Earth’s atmosphere. This process is called Rayleigh scattering. Key points: Sunlight is made of many colors (wavelengths). Shorter wavelengths, like violet and blue, are scattered much more strongly by air molecules than longer wavelengths like red. The scattering strength increases sharply as wavelength gets shorter. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the shorter-wavelength light (especially blue) is scattered in all directions, so no matter where you look away from the Sun, you see that scattered blue light — the “blue sky.” Why not violet? The Sun emits less violet than blue. Our eyes are less sensitive to violet. Some violet/UV is absorbed higher up by ozone. Together, that makes the scattered light we perceive look mainly blue. Why are sunsets red/orange? Near sunrise and sunset, sunlight travels a much longer path through the atmosphere. Much of the blue light gets scattered out of the direct path before it reaches your eyes, leaving the remaining direct sunlight enriched in reds and oranges. Other influences: Haze, pollution, smoke, or dust have larger particles that scatter light less selectively (called Mie scattering), making the sky look paler or whitish. The blue sky is partially polarized due to the scattering geometry, which is why polarized sunglasses can darken parts of it. On worlds with different atmospheres and particle sizes (like Mars), skies can look butterscotch or reddish for similar scattering reasons. If Earth had no atmosphere, there would be nothing to scatter sunlight, and the sky would appear black even in daytime, with the Sun as a bright disk. Preamble messages before tool calls If instructed, GPT‑5 will output user-visible preamble messages before and between tool calls. Unlike hidden reasoning messages, these visible messages allow GPT‑5 to communicate plans and progress to the user, helping end users understand its approach and intent behind the tool calls. Custom tools We’re introducing a new tool type—custom tools—that allows GPT‑5 to call a tool with plaintext instead of JSON. To constrain GPT‑5 to follow custom tool formats, developers can supply a regex, or even a more fully specified context-free grammar ⁠ (opens in a new window) . Previously, our interface for developer-defined tools required them to be called with JSON, a common format used by web APIs and developers generally. However, outputting valid JSON requires the model to perfectly escape all quotation marks, backslashes, newlines, and other control characters. Although our models are well-trained to output JSON, on long inputs like hundreds of lines of code or a 5-page report, the odds of an error creep up. With custom tools, GPT‑5 can write tool inputs as plaintext, without having to escape all of the characters that require escaping. On SWE-bench Verified using custom tools instead of JSON tools, GPT‑5 scores about the same. Safety GPT‑5 advances the frontier on safety and is a more robust, reliable, and helpful model. GPT‑5 is significantly less likely to hallucinate than our previous models, more honestly communicates its actions and capabilities to the user and provides the most helpful answer where possible while still staying within safety boundaries. You can read more in our research blog . Availability &amp; pricing GPT‑5 is available now in the API platform in three sizes: gpt-5 , gpt-5-mini , and gpt-5-nano . It’s available on the Responses API, Chat Completions API, and is the default in Codex CLI. GPT‑5 is priced at $1.25/1M input tokens and $10/1M output tokens, GPT‑5 mini is priced at $0.25/1M input tokens and $2/1M output tokens, and GPT‑5 nano is priced at $0.05/1M input tokens and $0.40/1M output tokens. These models support the reasoning_effort and verbosity API parameters, as well as custom tools. They also support parallel tool calling, built-in tools (web search, file search, image generation, and more), core API features (streaming, Structured Outputs, and more), and cost-saving features such as prompt caching and Batch API. The non-reasoning version of GPT‑5 used in ChatGPT is available in the API as gpt-5-chat-latest , also priced at $1.25/1M input tokens and $10/1M output tokens. GPT‑5 is also launching across Microsoft platforms, including Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot, GitHub Copilot, and Azure AI Foundry.

GPT-5 Benchmarks See how GPT-5 performs across benchmarks; with a big focus on health • 7 min Written by Anita Kirkovska Reviewed by No items found. CONTENTS Inline evaluation / Guardrails: Ensure good system performance at run-time This is some text inside of a div block. GPT-5 is finally here! It comes with 400k context window, and 128k output window. That’s a nice upgrade, given that the price is on the lower end $1.25/$10 for input/output tokens. It’s available in ChatGPT Pro and in the API starting today. It feels like this model is topping all benchmarks right now, and it’s a model that’s greatly optimized for reliability, health queries and safety. Let’s take a look! 💡 Want to see how GPT-5 compares to Claude, Gemini, Grok for your use case? Compare them in Vellum. Math capabilities This is the first time we’re seeing 100% on a newly generated benchmark like AIME 2025. This benchmark is modeled after the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), a high-school level math competition in the U.S. ‍ From these benchmarks we can see that: GPT-5 pro (with Python tools) scores a perfect 100% accuracy &quot;With thinking&quot; (chain-of-thought) gives a big boost to all versions of GPT-5, especially the one without Python tools (jumping from 71.0% to 99.6%). GPT-4o in comparison looks so bad here :) But how does it compare with other models on the market? If we check our leaderboard , we can notice that OpenAI is dominating this benchmark, and only Grok 3 managed to secure a spot in the top 5 here: Reasoning capabilities When it comes to reasoning capabilities, we usually look at the GPQA Diamond benchmark. From the image above we can see that: GPT-5 pro (with Python tools) scores the highest at 89.4% on PhD-level science questions, slightly ahead of its no-tools variant. &quot;Thinking&quot; helps noticeably , especially for GPT-5 (no tools), which jumps from 77.8% to 85.7% when reasoning is enabled. GPT-4o falls behind at 70.1% , showing a big gap in handling complex scientific reasoning compared to GPT-5 variants. From our leaderboard we can see that GPT-5 Pro (Python) is at the first place when compared to other models on the market. Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 4 are close behind on this one. Code capabilities Now this is where things get interesting. Historically Claude models were stealing the spot for all things related to coding capabilities. The SWE-bench Verified: Tests how well models can fix real-world GitHub issues by editing code. The other benchmark, Aider Polyglot, measures multi-language code editing skills, checking if models can make correct changes across different programming languages. Both are widely used to evaluate these models on software engineering tasks. We can see that GPT-5 leads both academic benchmarks when compared with other OpenAI models, on SWE-bench Verified it’s at 74.9% and Aider Polyglot at 88% when “thinking” (chain-of-thought reasoning) is enabled. Reasoning gives a huge boost to GPT-5: +22.1 points on SWE-bench and +61.3 points on Aider Polyglot. GPT-4o performs the weakest in both benchmarks, showing limited ability to solve complex code-related tasks compared to newer models. How does it compare with other models? For the SWE-bench comparison, Grok 4, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.1 all perform similarly. To get a clearer picture, we’ll need more practical tests from coding agents like Codium, Lovable, and other tools built for real-world dev workflows. Reliability capabilities The biggest emphasis with GPT-5 is on reliability and safety ; especially when it comes to health-related questions , where accuracy truly matters. GPT-5 (with thinking) has the lowest hallucination and error rates across all benchmarks. Under 1% on open-source prompts and just 1.6% on hard medical cases (HealthBench). Reasoning mode makes a big difference : GPT-5 drops from 11.6% to 4.8% in real-world traffic error rates when “thinking” is used. GPT-4o seems like a very bad model here. It has very high error rates , especially on HealthBench ( 15.8% ) and traffic prompts ( 22.0% ). OpenAI o3 performs better than GPT-4o , but still lags GPT-5 in all categories Looks like they meant it when they called GPT-5 the most reliable and factual model yet. Humanity’s Last Exam We also benchmark these models on the Humanity’s Last exam which is designed to push AI to its limits across a wide array of subjects. GPT-5 pro (with tools and reasoning) has 42% accuracy on expert-level questions, slightly ahead of the best-performing ChatGPT agent setup (41.6%). &quot;Thinking&quot; dramatically boosts performance , especially for base GPT-5 (no tools), jumping from 6.3% to 24.8% . Agent-based setups (using tools like browser and terminal) still lag behind GPT-5 pro, showing there’s room for improvement in tool orchestration. And even across ALL other models, the jump in performance from GPT-5 is staggering. They almost doubled the accuracy from the previous OpenAI O3 model, and it’s noticeably more ahead from any other model on the market. Conclusion I’ll keep it short. Seems like OpenAI has the leading model on the market, once again. Go update all of your models :) GPT-5 is finally here! It comes with 400k context window, and 128k output window.

Models that once posted flattering scores on friendly tests just met a harder exam, and the grade stings. On SWE-Bench Pro , the new benchmark for real software engineering, top models that cruised at more than 70 percent on older suites now stall around 23 percent. That’s not a rounding error. It’s a reality check for AI software engineering and the start of a healthier conversation about evaluating AI agents. Table of Contents Introduction 1.

What The Results Say About Today’s Models 9. The Culture Shift That Hard Benchmarks Enable 10. A Roadmap For The Next Year 11. Closing: A Hard Reset We Needed 1. The Saturation Problem: Why A New Benchmark Was Urgently Needed The field needed SWE-Bench Pro because our previous yardsticks stopped moving the needle. On tests like SWE-Bench Verified, leaders regularly cleared a high bar. Then it became a low bar. When a benchmark saturates, you lose the ability to tell whether a jump is genuine capability or clever test practice. The effect is simple. Models look better, teams celebrate, product roadmaps lean forward, and, quietly, the hard problems remain unsolved. There was a deeper flaw too, and the paper names it clearly, AI benchmark contamination . Public issues, permissive licenses, and web-scale crawls create a pipeline from GitHub into model pretraining. When answers leak into training data, a model can “remember” solutions. It looks smart on paper. It’s just well read. SWE-Bench Pro was built to break that loop, and to restore trust in the signal we get from an AI coding benchmark. 2. Inside SWE-Bench Pro: What Makes It So Much Harder? SWE-Bench Pro raises the difficulty in three decisive ways. It does not try to trick models with puzzles. It tries to mirror work that engineers actually do in the wild. 2.1 Enterprise-Level Difficulty Over-shoulder view of repo navigation and multi-file diffs that typify SWE-Bench Pro enterprise-level difficulty. The benchmark asks agents to resolve real issues in full repositories. The median change is not a one-line fix. The reference solutions average more than 100 lines across multiple files, with environments that must build, test, and hold up across runs. That forces long-horizon planning, tool use, file navigation, and consistent edits that compile and pass tests . In other words, the things that make engineering hard. SWE-Bench Pro requires the same. 2.2 Contamination-Resistant By Design Photoreal lock and data pipeline barrier symbolizing contamination resistance in SWE-Bench Pro. To blunt data leakage, the public portion draws from GPL and other strong copyleft repos, and the commercial portion comes from private startup codebases under partnership. Those sources are difficult to absorb into proprietary training sets, legally and practically. You cannot memorize what you cannot see. SWE-Bench Pro keeps a held-out set private as well, so the community has a way to check for overfitting later. This keeps the scoreboard honest. 2.3 Human-Centered Verification And Unified Evaluation Settings Every instance is human-augmented to include a problem statement, a clear list of requirements, and, when needed, an explicit interface. That reduces ambiguity and focuses the challenge on implementation, not scavenger hunts. All models run under the same scaffold, SWE-Agent, with tool use enabled, a shared base prompt , and the same turn limits. Open-weight models are hosted with vLLM on a single node equipped with eight H100 GPUs. SWE-Bench Pro keeps the playing field level and reproducible. 3. The Sobering Results: A Head-To-Head Model Comparison The headline is simple. Even the best agents fail most of the time on SWE-Bench Pro. The nuance still matters, so let’s look at both subsets that the paper reports. 3.1 Public Set Results GPT-5 edges out the competition on the public set. The margin is small, and the ceiling is low. Model performance on the public set of SWE-Bench Pro (N = 731). MODEL RESOLVE (%) OPENAI GPT-5 23.3 CLAUDE OPUS 4.1 22.7 CLAUDE SONNET 4 17.6 GEMINI 2.5 PRO PREVIEW 13.5 SWE-SMITH-32B 6.8 OPENAI GPT-4O 4.9 QWEN-3 32B 3.4 Table 1: Model performance on the public set of SWE-Bench Pro (N = 731). Evaluated with SWE-Agent. Ambiguity is minimized with augmented statements, requirements, and interface. 3.2 Commercial Set Results Claude Opus 4.1 takes the commercial crown . These issues come from proprietary startup codebases and carry a bite that the public set cannot match. Model performance on the commercial set of SWE-Bench Pro (N = 276). MODEL RESOLVE (%) CLAUDE OPUS 4.1 17.8 OPENAI GPT-5 14.9 GEMINI 2.5 PRO PREVIEW 10.1 CLAUDE SONNET 4 9.1 OPENAI GPT-4O 3.6 Table 2: Model performance on the commercial set of SWE-Bench Pro (N = 276). Each problem includes a runnable environment and relevant context. 3.3 Takeaways And A Human Baseline A few observations stand out. GPT-5 wins narrowly on the public side, which signals strong GPT-5 coding capabilities. Claude 4.1 coding strength shows up in the commercial slice. Gemini 2.5 Pro earns respectable middle-of-the-pack results. Open-source models lag here, despite strong showings on simpler tasks. The most important note, though, is the failure rate. On SWE-Bench Pro, even leaders miss more than three out of four attempts. Humans solved these issues in real repositories. So the AI vs human programmer baseline sits at 100 percent given enough time. The gap is real, and it is measurable. 4. What Do These Failures Look Like? Not all misses are equal. The paper clusters failure modes, and they read like a postmortem wall in a busy codebase. On bigger agents you see semantic misses, algorithmic slips, and edits that weave across files without fully landing. On smaller open models you see syntax breaks, formatting errors, brittle tool use, and context overflow from heavy directory listings. SWE-Bench Pro surfaces these patterns clearly because the tasks pull agents into the places where bugs like to hide. It also confirms a blunt fact about evaluating AI agents. Interface design, file navigation, and tool plumbing are part of the score, not a footnote. 5. Why This Benchmark Matters For Research And Product A hard benchmark is not a setback. It is a map. SWE-Bench Pro gives research teams a durable signal that won’t collapse after two leaderboard cycles. Scores below 25 percent are not a failure of ambition. They are a measure. A model that improves five points here has done more than memorize a pattern. It has learned to reason across files, keep context straight , and propose edits that compile and pass tests. That’s what progress in AI software engineering looks like. This also shifts incentives. You cannot cram for SWE-Bench Pro by embedding solutions into training sets you don’t own. You need better planners, better memory, fewer blind file listings, stronger type awareness, better judgment about when to run tests, and tighter feedback loops between tools and natural language. You need agents that can decompose, stage changes, write focused diffs, and roll back gracefully. That is the work. 6. How To Read The Numbers Without Fooling Yourself Benchmarks compress messy reality into one metric. That can be useful. It can also be misleading if you ignore the setup. On SWE-Bench Pro, keep three anchors in mind. Contamination resistance. Public GPL repos and private startup codebases reduce leakage. The number means more. SWE-Bench Pro defends its signal. Human augmentation. Every instance includes a cleaned problem statement and explicit requirements. The test asks, can you implement a working fix, not can you guess the missing context. SWE-Bench Pro aims at execution. Unified evaluation. Same scaffold, same prompt, same limits, same hardware envelope. Variance that remains reflects agent behavior, not lab quirks. SWE-Bench Pro keeps the comparison honest. With that framing, a 23.3 percent Pass@1 is not a dunk. It is a credible benchmark result on a demanding suite. That is exactly what a trustworthy AI coding benchmark should deliver. 7. What Builders Should Do Next Team plans compile-test loops and focused diffs inspired by SWE-Bench Pro recommendations on a bright whiteboard. If you are shipping coding agents, don’t chase leaderboard spikes that vanish when the task shifts. Build toward SWE-Bench Pro, then beyond it. A practical plan looks like this. Treat repos as living systems. Build retrieval around interfaces and invariants, not keywords. Encourage models to read less and index smarter. SWE-Bench Pro punishes endless file reading. Lean into tool use with guardrails . Enforce compile-test loops that are short, deterministic, and visible to the planner. Strip noisy logs and cap directory listings. SWE-Bench Pro rewards agents that manage context like a resource. Prefer surgical diffs. Generate patch sets that are small, testable, and reversible. Encourage models to stage changes before broad edits . SWE-Bench Pro is multi-file, but good agents still change only what they must. Diagnose failures with structure. Classify misses into syntax, wrong solution, tool error, context overflow, or misread requirements. Then fix the class, not the instance. SWE-Bench Pro makes the buckets explicit. Use them. Focus on generalization, not tricks. Private sets will catch overfitting. Long-term gains come from planning and representation learning, not prompt lore. SWE-Bench Pro will keep you honest. 8. What The Results Say About Today’s Models It is tempting to narrate winners and losers. That misses the point. GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1 look strong because they keep their footing across languages and repos. They still stumble, often on semantic and algorithmic edges. Gemini 2.5 Pro is capable, but not dominant. Open-weight models bring agility and control , yet on SWE-Bench Pro they often lose on syntax, formatting, and fragile tool use. 9. The Culture Shift That Hard Benchmarks Enable A strong benchmark often resets taste. After SWE-Bench Pro, results from light synthetic tasks will feel less convincing. That is healthy. It nudges the field toward grounded evaluation and away from colorful demos that crumble under integration . It also re-centers the role of engineering. To move the number on SWE-Bench Pro, you need better context windows, yes, but also better editors, smarter file search, quicker build-test loops, and debugging tools that models can drive. You need systems thinking. This is where the Karpathy mindset helps. Clear, iterative loops. Small, measurable deltas. Tight feedback. This is where the Chollet mindset helps too. Think about abstraction, representation, and the shape of the problem, not just the size of the model. Apply that blend to SWE-Bench Pro and you get a research plan that is humane and ambitious at the same time. 10. A Roadmap For The Next Year If you work in a lab, pick a public subset of SWE-Bench Pro and make it your weekly barometer. Track Pass@1, but also track secondary signals that reflect real progress, like compile success rate, patch size distribution, and number of files edited per success. Rotate repos and languages. Add gates to prevent regressions. Ship only when the number moves on SWE-Bench Pro, not just on your internal smoke tests. If you are a product team, integrate the same ideas in your experience. Expose a diff-first workflow. Highlight risky edits. Let users dial tool aggression up or down. Give them a button that runs only fail-to-pass tests. Then collect structured failure reports that map back to the buckets the paper uses. That turns user friction into training signal. SWE-Bench Pro shows how to make that loop rigorous. 11. Closing: A Hard Reset We Needed The message is not that agents cannot code. It is that the path to trustworthy, production-grade agents passes through benchmarks that refuse to make life easy. SWE-Bench Pro is that kind of test. It is contamination resistant. It is long-horizon. It is human verified. It is the best public mirror we have today for the reality of professional software work. The current score, about 23 percent on the public set and even lower on the commercial one, is not a verdict. It is a baseline. If you care about the future of coding tools, align your roadmap with SWE-Bench Pro. Build planners that think in files, not lines. Design editors the agent can trust. Make tests fast and decisive. Then publish your gains on SWE-Bench Pro, not just in a demo video. The field will move faster when our measures are honest. The next leap will come from teams that take this challenge personally and treat it as the ground truth for progress.

Resolve Rate (sometimes called Pass@1) The percentage of benchmark issues an agent fully fixes under the official rules, including compiling and passing tests. Benchmark Saturation A state where scores cluster near the top, making the test too easy and weak at measuring real progress. Data Contamination When training data contains answers or near-duplicates of test problems, which inflates benchmark scores without reflecting true capability. Contamination Resistance Design choices that limit leakage, for example using GPL or other copyleft repositories and private commercial codebases, plus held-out splits that are not publicly accessible. Copyleft License (for example, GPL) A license that requires derivative works to remain under the same license terms. It discourages simple ingestion into proprietary training sets and reduces the chance of answer leakage. Held-Out Set A private portion of the benchmark kept off the public internet, used to test whether models generalize rather than memorize. Long-Horizon Reasoning Planning and executing many coordinated steps, such as making 100-plus lines of edits across several files, while keeping the repository consistent. Human-in-the-Loop Verification A multi-stage review where people refine problem statements, clarify requirements, and confirm that tests validate the intended fix. Tool Use An agent’s ability to call external utilities, for example running unit tests, invoking linters, searching files, executing git commands, or launching build scripts. SWE-Agent The standardized evaluation scaffold that runs models with the same prompt, tool interface, limits, and scoring logic to keep comparisons fair. vLLM A high-throughput inference engine used to host open-weight models for consistent, reproducible evaluation on shared hardware. Compile-Test Loop The tight cycle of building the project and running tests after each proposed change, used to validate whether a patch truly resolves the issue. Diff-First Workflow A practice where the agent proposes focused patches as small diffs, reviews them, then applies changes, which helps control scope and reduce regressions. Context Window and Overflow The maximum input and conversation length a model can hold at once. Overflow occurs when prompts, logs, or file listings exceed this limit and get truncated, which can break reasoning. SWEAP Eval PDF (Scale) SWE-Bench Pro Blog Post (Scale) Q: What is SWE-Bench Pro and why is it a big deal? A: SWE-Bench Pro is a harder, contamination-resistant benchmark for AI coding agents that evaluates real, enterprise-grade issues with multi-file edits, long-horizon reasoning, and human-verified briefs. Top frontier models score near 23 percent, which turns marketing claims into measurable reality. Q: How is SWE-Bench Pro different from the old SWE-Bench? A: The original SWE-bench and its Verified subset rely on public GitHub issues and were nearing saturation for top models. SWE-Bench Pro adds private commercial repos and copyleft public code, clearer human-augmented prompts, and a unified agent scaffold, which reduces leakage and raises difficulty. Q: Why do top models like GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 have low scores on this new benchmark? A: Tasks demand 100-plus lines of coordinated changes across files, robust tool use, and end-to-end test passing in realistic environments. With contamination controls in place, memorization offers little help, so even leaders land around 23 percent on the public set and lower on the commercial set. Q: Is SWE-Bench Pro resistant to data contamination? A: Yes. SWE-Bench Pro mixes GPL-licensed public code that is hard to include legally in training with private startup repositories and held-out splits, which sharply limits training exposure. This follows the broader push toward contamination-resistant evaluation. Q: What does this new benchmark tell us about the future of AI in software engineering? A: SWE-Bench Pro shows that credible progress will come from better planning, tool orchestration, and repository-level reasoning, not from prompt tricks. It gives the field a durable yardstick to track real capability gains on production-like tasks.

Members Online • AI_is_the_rake Which AI coding tool gives the most GPT-5 access for the cost? $200/month ChatGPT Pro is too steep Discussion Now that GPT-5 is officially out (released August 2025), I&#39;m trying to figure out the most cost-effective way to get maximum access to it for coding. The $200/month ChatGPT Pro with unlimited GPT-5 is way over my budget. What are you guys using? Current options I&#39;m comparing: Windsurf ($15/month Pro): Has high 500 credits/month (≈$20 value) Explicitly offers GPT-5 Low, Medium, AND High reasoning levels GPT-5 Low = 0.5 credits per request Free tier: 25 credits/month + unlimited SWE-1 GitHub Copilot ($10/month Pro): Doesn&#39;t say so probably not high GPT-5 mini included unlimited Full GPT-5 available but uses &quot;premium requests&quot; (300/month included) Doesn&#39;t specifically mention &quot;GPT-5 High&quot; - appears to be standard GPT-5 Can add more premium requests at $0.04 each Cursor : Uses API pricing for GPT-5 (promotional pricing ended) Pro plan (~$20 monthly usage budget) No clear mention of GPT-5 High vs standard - seems to use OpenAI&#39;s standard API models Charges at OpenAI API rates ($1.25/1M input, $10/1M output tokens) OpenAI Codex CLI : Uses GPT-5-Codex (specialized version of GPT-5 for coding) Available via ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) or Pro ($200/month) subscriptions Can work via terminal, IDE integration, or web interface Question: Does this make the other tools redundant? Questions for those using these: GPT-5 High access : Can anyone confirm if GitHub Copilot or Cursor actually give you access to the high-reasoning version, or just standard GPT-5? Real-world Windsurf usage : How many GPT-5 High requests can you actually make with 500 credits on Windsurf Pro? Codex CLI vs third-party tools : Is there any advantage to using Cursor/Windsurf/Copilot if you can just use Codex CLI directly? Do the integrations matter that much? Quality difference : For those who&#39;ve used both, is GPT-5 High noticeably better than standard GPT-5 for complex coding tasks? Hidden costs : Any gotchas with these credit/token systems? From what I can tell, Windsurf might be the only one explicitly offering GPT-5 High reasoning , but I&#39;d love confirmation from actual users. Also curious if Codex CLI makes these other options unnecessary? Read more Share"
