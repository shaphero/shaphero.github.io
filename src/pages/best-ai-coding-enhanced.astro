        "content": "Every day I see another post about Claude or o3 being \"better at coding\" and I'm fucking tired of it. You're all missing the point entirely.\n\nHere's the reality check you need: These AIs aren't better at coding. They've just memorized more shit. That's it. That's literally it.\n\nWant proof? Here's what happens EVERY SINGLE TIME:\n\n1. Give Claude a problem it hasn't seen: *spends 2 hours guessing at solutions*\n2. Add ONE FUCKING PRINT STATEMENT showing the output: \"Oh, now I see exactly what's wrong!\"\n\nNO SHIT IT SEES WHAT'S WRONG. Because now it can actually see what's happening instead of playing guess-the-bug.\n\nSeriously, try coding without print statements or debuggers (without AI, just you). You'd be fucking useless too. We're out here expecting AI to magically divine what's wrong with code while denying them the most basic tool every developer uses.\n\n\"But Claude is better at coding than o1!\" No, it just memorized more known issues. Try giving it something novel without debug output and watch it struggle like any other model.\n\nI'm not talking about the error your code throws. I'm talking about LOGGING. You know, the thing every fucking developer used before AI was around?\n\nAll these benchmarks testing AI coding are garbage because they're not testing real development. They're testing pattern matching against known issues.\n\nWant to actually improve AI coding? Stop jerking off to benchmarks and start focusing on integrating them with proper debugging tools. Let them see what the fuck is actually happening in the code like every human developer needs to.\n\nThe fact thayt you specifically have to tell the LLM \"add debugging\" is a mistake in the first place. They should understand when to do so.\n\nNote: Since some of you probably need this spelled out - yes, I use AI for coding. Yes, they're useful. Yes, I use them every day. Yes, I've been doing that since the day GPT 3.5 came out. That's not the point. The point is we're measuring and comparing them wrong, and missing huge opportunities for improvement because of it.\n\nEdit: That‚Äôs a lot of \"fucking\" in this post, I didn‚Äôt even realize"

GPT-5/GPT-5 Pro**\n\nThe super solid advancements of OpenAI in **frontend UI** already give it an edge to leap ahead of Grok 4,Claude 4 &amp; Gemini 2.5 series in practical utility\n\nAnd of course,developers and other high taste testers would have maximum customisation powers to have **hair-thin precision control** over GPT-5's capabilities\n\nApart from that,the Open-Source model of OpenAI is still coming by the end of July and is the equivalent or a bit superior to **o3-mini**\n\nBut the most interesting aspect is gonna be its price-to-performance ratio,size,compute-efficiency and its integration with the Codex CLI\n\nAnd now,to the pulp of the core hype üòéüî•\n\n\"According to Yuchen Jin,one of the most reliable leakers....**GPT-6 is already in training**\"\n\nYes,you heard that right !!!\n\nGPT-6 is already in training....think about it for a sec.....between the leap of GPT-4 and GPT-5.....we have models that scale with:\n\n1)Pre-training compute\n\n2)RL compute\n\n3)Test-time compute\n\n4)Unified Agentic tool use\n\n5)Agentic swarms\n\n6)Multimodality\n\nAnd a model that has already scored an **IMO GOLD MEDAL ü•á **while displaying u**nprecedented generalization and meta-cognition capabilities.**...(which has been planned to be released by the end of the year üèéÔ∏èüí®)\n\nEither the IMO model or GPT-6 are gonna be the same released model by the end of the year....or GPT-6 will be **an even bigger leap forwardüìàüí•**\n\n**Sora 2** has been spotted in the docs and whether or not it releases along with GPT-5,one thing is for sure.... we're about to get a **new SOTA video+audio model** soon.\n\nSpeaking of massive leaps,OpenAI is developing **4.5 gigawatts of additional Stargate data center** capacity with Oracle in the U.S (for a total of **5+ GWs!**).\n\nAnd their Stargate I site in Abilene, TX is starting to come **online** to power their **next-generation AI research.**\n\n**Aaaaannnndddd...xAI** is in a league of its own for now,when it comes to **bombshell leaps**\n\n**230k GPUs**, including 30k GB200s, are operational for training Grok@xAIin a **single supercluster called Colossus 1.**\n\n(inference is done by their cloud providers).\n\nAt **Colossus 2**, the **first batch of 550k GB200s &amp;

Here's how it actually works when you ask it to \"add authentication to my API\":\n\n1. **File Explorer Agent** scans your entire codebase to understand the architecture and find relevant files\n2. **Planner Agent** determines which files need changes and in what order\n3. **Implementation Agents** make precise edits across multiple files\n4. **Review Agents** validate changes and run tests\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4k46nl4d0hof1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f390dbdea16882e550fc34b66701cbc071365efe\n\nThis approach gives you much better context understanding and fewer errors compared to single-model tools. In their internal testing, CodeBuff scored 61% vs Claude Code's 53% across 175+ real-world coding tasks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt01c8le0hof1.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b51b6d1732f767caa2f93442299e8d1f244a4705\n\n# Installation: Super Simple\n\nGetting started is straightforward:\n\n**Install the CLI**\n\n    npm install -g codebuff\n\n**Navigate to your project**\n\n    cd your-project\n\n**Start CodeBuff**\n\n    codebuff\n\n**That's it! You can now give it natural language commands like:**\n\n\\- \"Fix the SQL injection vulnerability in user registration\"\n\n\\- \"Add rate limiting to all API endpoints\"\n\n\\- \"Refactor the database connection code for better performance\"\n\n# Creating Custom Agents: Where It Gets Really Interesting\n\nThis is where CodeBuff really shines compared to other tools. You can create your own specialized agents for specific workflows.\n\n**Initialize custom agents:**\n\n    codebuff init-agents\n\n**Here's a practical example of a custom Security Vulnerability Scanner agent, that i use a lot personally**\n\n    export default {\n      id: 'security-scanner',\n      displayName: 'Security Scanner',\n      model: 'openai/gpt-4',\n      toolNames: ['read_files', 'find_files', 'run_terminal_command', 'write_files'],\n      instructionsPrompt: 'You are a security expert that scans code for vulnerabilities. Look for SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure authentication, and other common security issues. Provide detailed reports with file locations and suggested fixes.',\n      \n      async *handleSteps() {\n        // Find common vulnerability-prone file types\n        yield { tool: 'find_files', pattern: '**/*.{js,ts,py,php,java,go,rs,cpp,c}' }\n        \n        // Look for common security issue patterns\n        yield { tool: 'run_terminal_command', command: 'grep -r \"password.*=\" . --include=\"*.js\" --include=\"*.ts\" --include=\"*.py\" || echo \"No hardcoded passwords found\"' }\n        yield { tool: 'run_terminal_command', command: 'grep -r \"api_key.*=\" . --include=\"*.js\" --include=\"*.ts\" --include=\"*.py\" || echo \"No hardcoded API keys found\"' }\n        yield { tool: 'run_terminal_command', command: 'grep -r \"SELECT.*\\\\+\" . --include=\"*.js\" --include=\"*.ts\" --include=\"*.py\" --include=\"*.php\" || echo \"No potential SQL injection found\"' }\n        \n        // Generate comprehensive security report\n        yield 'STEP_ALL'\n      },\n    }\n\n**For programmatic control, there's also a full TypeScript SDK:**\n\n    npm install u/codebuff/sdk\n    \n    import { CodebuffClient } from '@codebuff/sdk'\n    const client = new CodebuffClient({\n      apiKey: 'your-api-key',\n      cwd: '/path/to/your/project',\n    })\n    \n    // Run a coding task\n    const result = await client.run({\n      agent: 'base',\n      prompt: 'Add comprehensive error handling to all API endpoints',\n      handleEvent: (event) =&gt; {\n        console.log('Progress', event)\n      },\n    })\n    \n    // Or run your custom agent\n    const myCustomAgent = {\n      id: 'greeter',\n      displayName: 'Greeter', \n      model: 'openai/gpt-5',\n      instructionsPrompt: 'Say hello!',\n    }\n    \n    await client.run({\n      agent: 'greeter',\n      agentDefinitions: [myCustomAgent],\n      prompt: 'My name is Bob.',\n    })\n\n# Real-World Use Cases :\n\n**I created a few of my own agents using this. want the code for these? comment.**\n\n\\- **Code review agents** that enforce my coding standards\n\n\\- **Testing agents** that automatically generate comprehensive test suites\n\n\\- **Documentation agents** that keep my docs in sync with code changes\n\n\\- **Deployment agents** that handle complex CI/CD workflows\n\n\\- **Refactoring agents** that specialize in specific types of code improvements"
