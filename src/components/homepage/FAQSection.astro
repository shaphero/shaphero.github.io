    question: "How do consultants remain viable with AI?",
    answer: "By becoming AI implementation experts, not just advisors. I help companies achieve 333% ROI with AI by focusing on actual workflow automation, not theoretical frameworks. The key is hands-on implementation that delivers measurable results within 30 days.",
    upvotes: 46
  },
  {
    question: "What's the real ROI of AI consulting for Fortune 500s?",
    answer: "My clients typically see 333% ROI within 6 months. Example: A Fortune 500 saved 20+ hours per week per team member through AI workflow automation, resulting in $2.4M annual savings. The key is focusing on high-impact, repeatable processes.",
    upvotes: 41
  },
  {
    question: "How long before AI implementation shows results?",
    answer: "First wins in 7-14 days, significant impact by 30 days, full ROI within 90 days. I use a phased approach: Week 1-2: Quick wins with existing tools. Week 3-4: Custom workflows. Month 2-3: Scale and optimize. No endless pilots—just rapid implementation.",

  },
  {
    question: "Why do 95% of Fortune 500 AI projects fail?",
    answer: "Three main reasons: 1) Starting too big instead of proving value quickly, 2) Focusing on technology instead of workflow integration, 3) Lack of employee training and adoption. I solve this with my 30-60-90 day implementation framework that ensures adoption and ROI.",
    upvotes: 26
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your approach different from other AI consultants?",
    answer: "I'm a practitioner, not a theorist. Former CMO who's actually implemented AI at scale. I don't sell 6-month discovery phases—I deliver working solutions in 30 days. Plus, I train your team to be self-sufficient, not dependent on consultants forever.",
